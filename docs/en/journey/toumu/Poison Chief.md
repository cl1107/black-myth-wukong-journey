From the peak of Mount Huaguo, struck by a celestial axe, many rocks and
trees tumbled down. Among them was a cliff rock that had absorbed the
essence of the universe for countless years. The axe's blow liberated it
from its burdens, granting it the potential to turn into something sentient.

Alongside this rock fell a crooked tree, severed in half with broken roots
and branches, appearing on the brink of death.

The tree implored the cliff rock, "We once occupied the same place. Now,
I am nearing death. Please, help me." The rock, perplexed, responded, "1
am but a mere rock. How could I offer you aid?" The tree explained, "You
possess spiritual potential. If you would allow me to anchor my roots in
your body for a few days, I might yet survive."

The rock, mindful of its reputation, reluctantly consented. The tree
entwined its ancient roots around the rock, securing itself firmly. When
the rock expressed discomfort, the tree replied, "I am heavy and must bind
tightly to prevent my fall."

Months passed, and the tree's vines and roots had deeply embedded
themselves into various parts of the rock. The rock, enduring great pain,
attempted to dislodge the tree with all its strength, but it felt as though it
was being torn apart. The roots had merged with the rock, making
separation impossible. Consumed by anger, the rock cursed the tree daily,
and both harbored mutual resentment.

Eventually, the crooked tree, now infused with the rock's spiritual
essence, began to emit toxins and prey upon living creatures. This
newfound power brought a strange harmony between them. Alas, how
unexpected it is to witness a relationship once fraught with conflict
transform into one of mutual benefit.
