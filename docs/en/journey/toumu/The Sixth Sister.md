# The Sixth Sister

> In hidden groves, a home appears,
> Laughter fills the path with flowers near.
> Girl chases the butterflies in flight,
> As rumors fade like shooting stars in the night.

In the Webbed Hollow, there were no children of the same age as the
Sixth Sister. She usually spent her time with her elder sisters, who were all
very nice to her. Only the fourth sister would strictly supervise her
training. Sometimes, when she trained diligently, the fourth sister would
take her to the mountain top to gaze at the scenery outside and tell her
stories about the world beyond the mountains.

Although she enjoyed following her fourth sister, the fourth sister often
went into the mountains to investigate secrets unknown to her. Claiming
it was dangerous, she refused to take her along, which left the Sixth Sister
feeling bored.

One day, a flower-viewing banquet was held in the mountains, and the
lesser yaoguais from Mount Wushan came to deliver gifts. As usual, after
completing their tasks, they were invited to stay and drink.

The elder sisters were busy entertaining guests and taking care of their
mother, so the Sixth Sister wandered off on her own. The steward guai,
unable to refuse her, had to accompany her around the cave for a while.

Two drunken pig guais saw the Sixth Sister and pointed at her, saying, "Is
that the one?" The other pig guai replied, "Yes, that's the one."

Feeling annoyed by their comments, the Sixth Sister retorted, "Why are
you pig guais pointing at me? Where are your manners? And what did you
mean for'this' and 'that'?"

The steward guai tried to signal the pig guais to shut up, but they
continued, "Little girl, let us tell you a secret that everyone knows but
you."

The steward guai quickly tried to intervene, but the Sixth Sister earnestly
said, "Go ahead."

The two pig guais laughed and said,"Your father is a pig, just like us. You
are a relative of our old pig family."

Contrary to their expectations, the little girl didn't burst in anger or throw
a tantrum. Instead, she pouted and spoke with a dismissive tone, saying,
"You must be attempting to establish a connection with me because you
lack skill in your craft and seek to exploit me. The one my mother chose
would never be someone as despicable as you."

Hearing this, the pig guais felt embarrassed and never dared to joke at her
again.
