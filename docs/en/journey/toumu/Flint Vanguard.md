# Flint Vanguard

> Odd rocks with fiery streaks, from a fiery river they rise,
> Forged in the blazing inferno, under the scorching skies.
> With loyalty, they shape rivers and move mountains high,
> Unmoved by the world's chaos, they stand firm and nigh.

Bodhisattva Guanyin was set to visit New Mount Sumeru to discuss
important Buddhist matters with Bodhisattva Lingji. As Red Boy was
always eager to serve Guanyin, he accompanied her on the journey.

Upon arriving at New Mount Sumeru, they learned that Bodhisattva Lingji
was still away on a trip to Yellow Wind Ridge. Thus, Guanyin turned
towards Yellow Wind Ridge. Given the urgency of the matter, she
instructed Red Boy to wait for her by the river valley.

As Red Boy wandered alone by the river, he noticed a massive rock guai
standing majestically by the water's edge like a giant guard hound. The
rock guai diligently moved stones and piled dirt into foothills. Intrigued,
committed the sight to memory.

Several years later, due to the Bull King's return to Flaming Mountains,
Guanyin suddenly summoned Red Boy and instructed him to fulfill his
duties to his family, allowing him to return to his homeland.

As time passed, travelers passing by the base of Flaming Mountains saw a
large flint rock guai, as big as a house, standing prominently by the fiery
river. It tirelessly moved stones and dirt, its diligent demeanor resembling
that of a giant guard hound, leaving people in awe and wonder.
