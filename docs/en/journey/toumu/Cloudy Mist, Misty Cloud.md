# Cloudy Mist, Misty Cloud

Once upon a time, there were three ghosts who shared a single body. They
aspired to earn the title of mountain deity and thus, with their bribe paid,
they targeted at a blind mountain deity of Mount Hao to take his place.

Although the mountain god was blind, his hearing was exceptionally
sharp. He was highly skilled in the art of smoke and fire, able to release
smoke to conceal his movements. Whenever the three ghosts came to
provoke him, he would immediately vanish into hiding.

One time, the three ghosts combined their powers to emit a sweeping
flash of lightning, forcing the mountain deity out of hiding. The mountain
deity cried out, waving his incense sticks wildly. The three ghosts, being
clumsy, couldn't dodge and got hit. Seeing their clothes catch fire, the
three ghosts forgot about the mountain deity and started blaming each
other.

As they quarreled, a burst of laughter echoed from the cliff. A young boy
with red skin and white hair sat there, watching them as if enjoying a
show.

Embarrassed and angry, the three ghosts and the mountain deity
temporarily set aside their differences and attacked the young boy. The
boy, finding it amusing, wielded a sharp spear and sparred with them.

Unexpectedly, the mountain deity's smoke perfectly concealed the clumsy
bodies of the three ghosts, while the ghosts' lightning provided
opportunities for the mountain deity to attack. Together, they managed to
fight the young boy for several rounds. It wasn't until the boy used his
Samadhi True Fire that they fell to the ground, begging for mercy.

Then, Red Boy told them,"From now on, these six hundred miles of
mountains are mine. You will follow me and become my captains."

From then on, the three ghosts were given a new name, "Cloudy Mist",
and the blind mountain deity was named "Misty Cloud". They continued
to serve Red Boy as a team, but their deep-seated animosity remained
unresolved, leading to frequent quarrels that persisted to this day.
