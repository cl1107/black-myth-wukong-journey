# Captain Void-Illusion

> "Contemplating the myriad forms, returning to the essence of nature."

With arrogance ablaze, his limbs torn,
You boasted of truth, a thousand hands adorned.
Yet the void illusion deceived and beguiled,
Mourned and lamented, your spirit defiled.
With bonds severed, in nirvana you were exiled.

In silence, in solitude, in tranquillity,
How painful it was to face death in clarity.
Detached from bitterness and pain,
Blessed, your flesh and blood through resentment shall remain.

May you cease the debate of falsehood and truth,
As the tide rises, cleansing with its mighty soothe.
