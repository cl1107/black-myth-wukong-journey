# The Third Sister

> In seclusion for a hundred springs,
> Truth and falsehood, the mountain brings.
> Rosy face turns into grey hair,
> Love stories seldom end fair.

The third daughter of the Zhu family, graceful in demeanor and gentle in
nature, loved reading and writing. Observing that her younger sisters
were still naive, and her two elder sisters were extremely busy, she
focused on needlework and became the best weaver in the family.

The fabric shop run by the second sister outside used weaving patterns
designed by the third sister. The weavers in the cave were also trained by
her. Due to her gentle and kind-hearted nature, she often found it
difficult to command the yaoguais. Thus, the fifth sister became her best
assistant. While the third sister taught with the weaving patterns in hand,
the fifth sister followed with a punishing ruler. If any weaver was
particularly unruly, the straightforward fifth sister would report them to
the second sister, who would then seal the offender in a cocoon to be used
as food.

Because the eldest and second sisters were often preoccupied with
various affairs, the fifth sister had been following the third sister since
childhood. The third sister was very quiet, so the fifth sister became her
lively counterpart. The two sisters bickered and quarreled, but it made the
days pass more easily.

Among the books the third sister often read were those strange mortal
anecdote. She always found them fascinating and longed to experience
those romantic scenes depicted. However, she was too wise to fall for any
romantic scholar, knowing that most yaoguais in those stories met tragic
ends.
