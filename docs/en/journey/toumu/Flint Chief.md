When it comes to who spoiled Red Boy the most in Flaming Mountains, it
has to be the Keeper. However, Red Boy didn't always appreciate it, much
like his parents, the Bull King and Lady Rakshasi, who took the Keeper's
efforts for granted. After all, he was not one of the family, and regardless
of how much effort he put in, to others, he was still an outsider.

One day, Red Boy demanded to have a Flint Vanguard, modeled after the
Stone Vanguard of Yellow Wind Ridge. The Bull King and Lady Rakshasi
did not favor the plan, but the Keeper immediately agreed. Fearing that
just a Stone Vanguard wouldn't be enough to entertain Red Boy, he went
ahead and created more rock guais. Among them was a giant rock guai
with arms and legs strong enough to support its massive body.

This giant rock guai was more formidable than the others, usually lying
dormant in the river of fire. It would only emerge when summoned by its
master or when a powerful enemy intruded. Red Boy didn't like these rock
guais that the Keeper had created without his permission and mostly
visited only the Flint Vanguard.

Since Red Boy lived with Lady Rakshasi in the Emerald Hall, the Keeper
stationed these rock guais in Furnace Valley. Later, when Red Boy
besieged Flaming Mountains, these rock guais from the river of fire proved
to be quite helpful, inevitably leading to some speculation over the Keeper
himself.
