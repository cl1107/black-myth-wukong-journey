# Jiao-Loong of Waves

> Green claws like steel, a crimson maw,
> Breath turns rain and wind with awe.
> Leaping waves, white crests arise,
> In the tides, life's fate lies.

Ancient texts record that the jiao is a divine creature of the waters, capable
of commanding fish to fly. When in water, it retains its divine nature;
when out of water, it loses its divinity.

In Village of Chen, there was a fisherman who, upon hearing Sun
Wukong's tale of dismantling the Linggan Temple, learned of a jiao that
could command the fish in the river. Inspired, the fisherman wished to
acquire the jiao's skills, hoping to make the fish leap into his nets, thus
saving everyone much labor.

One day, while out fishing, dark clouds gathered in the sky. Soon a fierce
storm erupted, unleashing torrential rain and violent waves. His fishing
boat was overturned by the waves, disappearing without a trace in the
blink of an eye.

By a stroke of fate, as he sank to the riverbed, he encountered the jiao deity
patrolling the river and was saved. The fisherman pleaded earnestly for
the deity to teach him some skills. Moved by his compassion, the jiao deity
taught him some practices of water beings.

Several days passed without the fisherman's return; everyone assumed he
had drowned in the storm. They prepared a simple coffin and planned to
erect a cenotaph in his memory.

On the day of the funeral, a downpour ensued, and a large jiao emerged
from the river. It swept its long tail, bringing many fish ashore. The
villagers rushed to the riverbank and saw the jiao transform into the
fisherman, walking out of the river. They were both astonished and
overjoyed.

However, after returning home, the fisherman soon felt his spirit weary
and only regained his vitality when he returned to the water. It was then
that everyone realized he could no longer live on land.

Indeed, a few days later, the fisherman leaped into the waves and
disappeared into the water, never to be seen again.
