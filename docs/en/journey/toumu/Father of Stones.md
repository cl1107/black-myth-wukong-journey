# Father of Stones

> In mountains, a deity grand,
> Envy not, but anger does stand.
> Within his grasp, a skeleton light,
> A romance lost in the distant land.

One day, a tattered-clothed girl stumbled into the valley of Yellow Wind
Ridge. Covered in wounds, she sought refuge in a cave belonging to a rock
guai after noticing some living goods inside.

When the Father of Stones discovered her presence, his initial intention
was to expel her. However, upon witnessing her pitiable condition, he
relented and granted her permission to rest for a while. To his surprise,
the girl ingeniously utilized the wild fruits and game found in the cave to
prepare a delectable meal. The tantalizing aroma tempted the Father of
Stones, leading him to reconsider his decision and allow her to stay and
continue cooking. From that point forward, the stone deity would
regularly procure ingredients, while the girl skillfully transformed them

into delicious dishes. Thus, the guai and the girl coexisted harmoniously
for a span of two years.

During a routine day of washing clothes by the river, the girl unexpectedly
encountered a woodcutter from her village. Overwhelmed with emotions
upon seeing a familiar face, she couldn't contain her tears upon returning
to the cave. Through her sobs, she revealed the harrowing truth that she
had fled from her abusive parents, who planned to force her into a
marriage with a foolish suitor in exchange for a dowry. The girl now lived
in constant fear of being captured and forcibly taken back to her
oppressive home.

As expected, the following day at noon, a group of villagers arrived at the
valley. The girl's parents, afraid of the yaoguai, desperately pleaded at the
entrance of the cave. Despite their pleas, the determined girl refused to
comply with their demands. Frustrated and enraged, her parents resorted
to cursing her. However, their vitriol subsided momentarily when the
Father of Stones emerged from the cave and bellowed a commanding
shout, causing the villagers to retreat in fear. Yet, as soon as the stone
deity returned inside, the villagers resumed their insults, persistently
tormenting the girl.

The Father of Stones decided to guard the entrance, but the girl's parents
threatened to bring a Daoist to subdue the stone guais if their daughter
was not returned.

Fearing that her presence would bring further trouble to the stone guais,
the girl made the difficult decision to quietly leave the cave during the
night. Tragically, she fell off a cliff and lost her life. The following day, the
stone guais discovered her lifeless body, already cold and devoid of any
signs of life.

Upon hearing about Lady Rakshasi of Flaming Mountains and her reputed
power and compassionate nature, the stone deity made a difficult journey,
carrying the girl's lifeless body to seek her help.

However, Lady Rakshasi, with her deep understanding of life and death,
examined the girl's body and came to a somber conclusion. She expressed
that attempting to revive her would be futile. Even if she were forcibly
brought back to life, she would be nothing more than a soulless shell,
devoid of the essence that made her who she was.

Unwilling to give up, the stone deity waited on the mountain path of
Flaming Mountains every day with the girl's body, hoping to gain
Rakshasi's sympathy. Even as the girl's flesh turned to bones, he did not
abandon his hope.
