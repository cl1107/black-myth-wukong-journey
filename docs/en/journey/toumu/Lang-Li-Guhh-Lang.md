Picking up from where we left off, that Daoist who had fled in disgrace
spent several years in secluded meditation in the mountains, mastering
the Five Thunder Technique until he could wield it with perfect ease.
Confident in his abilities, he set out once more.

During his journey, he captured a small electric tadpole and confined it
within his gourd. As he passed through the snowy mountains, the tadpole
began to stir restlessly inside the gourd, signaling the presence of a frog
guai nearby. Following the signs, he arrived at a deep, icy pool in a valley
and indeed found a giant frog, covered in frost and lying dormant by the
shore.

Without hesitation, the Daoist unleashed a thunderbolt at the frog,
expecting it to be struck down instantly. To his surprise, the frog leaped
high into the air and dodged the attack. Unperturbed, the Daoist cast
another thunderbolt, but the frog evaded it again, hopping closer with
each leap. Learnt from the past, the Daoist retreated several steps,
thinking himself clever. However, to his surprise, the frog stood on its
hind legs, puffed out its chest, lunged forward, and knocked the Daoist off
balance with its large belly. As he prepared to strike back, the frog opened
its mouth and blew a gust of icy wind, freezing him in place.

Just as the frog was about to devour him, a group of monks appeared from
the other side of the pool. Seeing the Daoist frozen there, they drove the
frog guai away, narrowly saving his life.
