# Tiger Vanguard

> Gathering strength with a mighty roar,
> Transforming stones, launching surprise once more.
> A loyal general with a heart so bold,
> A noble fighter, lost in the age of old.

The Tang Monk and his two disciples pressed on. Before half a day had
passed, they came upon a towering peak, dire to behold. As they gazed
upon it, there arose a tumult of wind, and from the mountainside leaped a
tiger, dappled and fierce, its tail lashing in the wind. "I am no common
beast!" it roared. "I am the Vanguard of the Yellow Wind King. By order of
my liege, I patrol this range and seek out mortals to serve as side dishes for
his brews."

The yaoguai closed in with a flurry of claws aimed at Bajie's face. Wukong
whipped out his staff with a shout, "Take him!"

Bajie rallied his courage, and the yaoguai fell back in disarray. Panicked, it
sloughed off its skin and draped it over a tiger-shaped rock. Loosed from
its flesh, it transformed into a screaming gale and raced back to the
mountain road. And there, it found the Tang Monk chanting his sutra. In a
trice, the tiger seized the monk and bore him away on the wind. The tiger
brought the monk to the mouth of a cave and, stilling the wind, spoke to
the guard, "Tell this to our master; the Tiger Vanguard has captured a
monk and awaits the king's decision at the gate."

The guard rushed in to report. Out came two tiger cubs who hailed the
vanguard as their father and made their courtesies. The older cub asked,
"Where did you find this pale-faced monk?" The vanguard laughed."A
stroke of luck! I was patrolling the mountain and chanced upon him." The
younger cub, overjoyed, said: "Well done, Father! Teach me how you did
it someday."

Even as they spoke, the master of the cave sent word: "Bring him in."
Along with his sons, the Tiger Vanguard presented the Tang Monk before
his master. "My king," the vanguard began, "I was honored with your
command to patrol the mountain. By chance, I came across a monk, none
other than the Tang emperor's sworn brother Tang Monk, bound for a
journey to the West to seek the scriptures. I seized him and now offer him
to grace your table." The master, surprised, demanded the full tale. The
vanguard knelt to one side and recounted the fight.

"Hold," said the cave master. "We do not eat him just yet." The vanguard
protested: "My king! It is against our nature to refuse the food before us."
But his master replied: "You do not understand. Eating him would be no
great matter, but I fear the two disciples of his will come clamoring at our
gate. It is safest to bind him to the windrest post in our rear garden. Wait
three days, or five; if his disciples do not come to our gate, we will boil,
steam, fry, or roast him at our leisure. There is no rush." The vanguard
rejoiced. "Wise beyond measure, my king! Wise indeed."

The two young tigers followed their father out. The elder muttered,
"Master has always devoured mortals without a second thought. There
should be something he left unsaid." The younger added: "He seems
almost... afraid of that mortal." Their father snapped: "You know nothing
of the powers of our master! Long seasons have I served him. How could
he shrink before any other?" The brothers exchanged glances but said no
more.

Scarcely half a day had passed when the master sent for them again. It was
Sun Wukong challenging upon their gate. The Tiger Vanguard requested
to face him, but the master demurred, "1 fear you cannot prevail against
him. You may well be wounded, and you must not then impute blame
unto me." The vanguard's sons urged him to reconsider, but he paid them
no heed. "Rest assured, you! Wait only until I return!"
