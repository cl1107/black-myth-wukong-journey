# Macaque Chief

> Once chief among the ranks, his countenance dark,
> In crimson silk pants, a striking mark.
> With icy blows, he mocks their plight,
> A jesting whiff, his foes left in a fright.

The Macaque Chief knelt with his back hunched, folding his dark wings
before the golden Buddha statue at the feet of Yellowbrow.

Yellowbrow raised his hand, pinching the feathers, and said, "Such crude
methods... The one who dared to use them on you monkeys was truly
ignorant of the ways of the world." With that, he waved his Spineshaft
Cudgel, and specks of Will poured over the Macaque Chief, shining like
the galaxy. The black wings trembled and retracted back into the monkey's
body. The Macaque Chief was stunned, and reached to touch his back,
overjoyed.

Yellowbrow laughed heartily, "You were a chief under Sun Wukong. Now
that he is dead, you need not wander anymore. I am rebuilding the New
Thunderclap Temple to save all from suffering. Why not stay here?"
Seeing the Macaque Chief hesitate, Yellowbrow continued,"1 know you
have endured much hardship. To rank among the high, one must first toil
among the low. You have already been low and toiled. Now, join me, and
my teachings will elevate you among the highest."

The Macaque Chief scratched his head, seeming tempted. Yellowbrow
added, "In this world, the weak are often oppressed, while the strong act
with impunity. The suffering you endured was ultimately due to a lack of
power. Think about it, if you had the abilities of that monkey who wreaked
such havoc in the Celestial Palace, it would have been others who would
have suffered."

Recalling the bitterness and hardships of the past years, the Macaque Chief
couldn't help but shed tears. He quickly prostrated himself at the feet of
the fat monk, kowtowing repeatedly.

Yellowbrow laughed heartily, unfastened the sack at his waist, and placed
the Macaque Chief inside. "Very well. I will teach you now," he said.
