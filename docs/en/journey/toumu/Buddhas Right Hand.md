# Buddha's Right Hand

> The hand that plucked lotus from waters pristine,
> Of the same species, yet not from the same egg, it seems.
> Who can discern right from left, in life's uncertain scheme?
> In this tangled web, truth and illusion gleam.

In the olden days, a Daoist brought a pair of enormous arms into the
Webbed Hollow. The lesser yaoguais had no idea where they came from,
but judging by their form, they must have belonged to a great master. The
Hundred- Eyed Daoist Master personally visited and placed two egg-like
objects within the arms, instructing the yaoguais to guard them diligently.

At first, the arms exuded a thick, foul-smelling fluid. After some time, the
fluid dried up, forming a thick blood membrane that encased the arms.

Years passed, and from a distance, one could see something writhing
within the blood membrane, as if something was growing inside, eager to
break free. Exactly ten years later, two insects emerged from the eggs.
Their bodies resembled bees, their tails like hands, and their venomous
spit could kill any bird or beast and wither any plant it touched.

The Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master rejoiced at the news and organized a
grand feast to celebrate. Amidst the banquet, he turned to the Violet
Spider and shared a tale. "You may not be aware, but I once attempted a
similar endeavor on Purple Cloud Mountain. Alas, the celestial eggs failed
to hatch as intended, and I faced severe reprimand from our master.
However, this time, I have come to realize that the celestial eggs bestowed
upon us were not meant for lofty destinies to ascend. Creating yaoguais,
on the other hand, is an ideal outcome."

One of the insects had a left hand for a tail, and the other had a right hand.
They loved to hang upside down from the cave ceiling, dangling their tails
to lure prey. When the prey approached, they would clap their hands
together, crushing the prey into a pulp before lowering their heads to
swallow it whole.

Later, the left-handed insect went into the mountains to practice, while
the right-handed one, unable to clap anymore, preferred to guard narrow
paths. There, it could take full advantage of the terrain to capture and
devour any intruders.
