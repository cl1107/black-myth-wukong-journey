# Captain Lotus-Vision

> "All things are by nature void... There is no wax or wane."

For pride and arrogance, your golden form is shattered.
From the rift shines Buddha's light, majestic and boundless.
With the glaring rays, flashing, startling, breaking,
You forget the teachings and fall into the false.

You are alone, isolated, crippled,
Dancing, prancing, like a deity or ghost, no less.
Here the wise go mad, the brave turn bad, the kind face duress.
Tainted by worldly dust, your practice is in a mess.

May your body enlighten the world and
Quell your proud and overbearing, merging light and darkness.
