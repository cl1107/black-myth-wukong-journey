In the lands west of Black Wind Mountain, within a kingdom named
Hhami, stood a small town. Every day before dawn, a humble market
would gather just outside the town gate. It was a place where peddlers
exchanged goods while waiting for the gate to open, but due to the prices,
even the townsfolk began to participate. Thus, this market gradually
gained its reputation.

A few months ago, an odd oil peddler arrived at the market. Garbed in
robes of a pearly turquoise color and with eyes that gleamed like copper
bells. He had a voice that rang out with a boom, and his breath was foul
and pungent. Yet, he happened to be a keen talker and naturally was
disliked by everyone. The oil he produces, on the other hand, was sought
after by everyone. Who would not prefer the oil clear and smooth, and
not to mention its price: one could exchange but a pinch of fragrant
powder for a large gourd of such oil.

One day, a wandering Daoist passed through the town and decided to visit
the market. He enjoyed his experience until he sensed an eerie green mist
emanating from that old peddler-a guai, no doubt. The monk chanted,
and before the peddler could manage a decent struggle, it revealed its true
form-a green-skinned giant frog.

The bystanders were startled and grabbed whatever they could use to
attack. The frog kicked the ground with both legs, leaped higher than a
tree, and swiftly fled toward the mountains. In pursuit, the folks arrived at
the marshes, where they witnessed countless small frogs scraping mucus
from each other's bodies, collecting it in a large barrel. They then applied
fragrant powder to themselves, hugging and sniffing each other in sheer
delight.

Silently, the people approached and peered into the barrel. The mucus
inside gleamed with clarity, just like the oil they had favored. At the sight,
they were occupied by bouts of nausea and began to vomit. None had the
strength to pursue and kill guais. All the frogs noticed this and hastily fled,
leaving the marshes filled with a rather unique scene.
