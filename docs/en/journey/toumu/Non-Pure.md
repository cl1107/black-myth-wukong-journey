# Non-Pure

> A wide heart, a plump form, a belly so grand,
> A fierce look, drooping lips, a visage unplanned.
> Steadfast as a mountain, he stays still,
> From toils, he hides, guarding the temple's hill.

In the vast sky, snowflakes drifted down, covering the exquisite palaces
and towers, and blanketing the mountain ridge year after year without
ceasing for a moment. In stark contrast to this relentless snow, Non-Pure
was someone who constantly sought to shirk his duties and laze around.
One day, while Non-Pure was on guard in the side hall, ready to respond
to his master's call at any moment, he heard the sounds of a fight outside.
Thunder Rhino Master came running to report that some unknown
yaoguai from the mountains was trying to force his way in to see their
master.

Non-Pure nonchalantly replied, "You go out and deal with him first. I'll
grab my spade and join you shortly." After Thunder Rhino Master left the
side hall, Non-Pure sat back down on his meditation cushion, reclining
lazily. Outside, the yaoguai loudly demanded to see the Buddha of the
Future and to become his disciple, while the sounds of the fight grew
more intense.

Thunder Rhino Master returned to ask for help again. Non-Pure stood up
and said, "You and the two overlords hold him off. Don't let him in. My
spade's blade is a bit dull; I'll come once I've sharpened it." After a while,
the noise outside quieted down. Thunder Rhino Master came back to
report that the yaoguai seeking guidance had been accidentally killed by
the overlords.

Non-Pure praised, "You did well. Throw the body into the dry well so it
doesn't dirty this place." Hearing this, Thunder Rhino Master sighed
inwardly, lamenting the yaoguai's ill fate. If another brother had been on
guard, perhaps the yaoguai might have actually met their master.

Unexpectedly, when discarding the body, Thunder Rhino Master
discovered that the yaoguai had talismans for summoning fire and
lightning stuck to his body, indicating he had come seeking revenge
against their master. At this news, Thunder Rhino Master was both
shocked and secretly relieved.
