# Quick as Fire, Fast as Wind

> Fiery spirit, life he stakes, Madness flaunts the wind he makes.
> Nostrils flare with smoky breath, Mouth exclaims with flames of death.
> Smoke ascends, the wind does chase, Fire spreads with wind's embrace.
> Loyalty worth a thousand gold, Together strong, their bond unfolds.

In bygone days, there were two ruffians wandering the city, always
spending their nights beneath the same section of the city wall, thus
forming a close bond.

With no attachments or concerns, they acted recklessly and without
restraint. One time, during their robbery of a wealthy young master, they
accidentally killed him, leading to their joint sentencing to death by
beheading, their execution scheduled in the autumn.

While imprisoned, one ruffian said to the other, "We've had a carefree
life, and if we must die, so be it. It's a pity we won't be able to enjoy
ourselves together anymore.".

The other ruffian replied, "If you wish to continue our fun together, it's
not impossible. I am a descendant of the 'Falling Head Clan' and possess
some tricks." He then whispered a set of skills into his companion's ear.

Come autumn, the two were beheaded in the public square. As the
executioner sprayed wine and swung his blade, their heads fell to the
ground but suddenly flew up into the air, much to the astonishment and
cheers of the onlookers.

Afterwards, the two heads flew into the mountains and became yaoguais,
one named "Quick as Fire" and the other "Fast as Wind".
