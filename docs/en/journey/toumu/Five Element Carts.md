# Five Element Carts

> Five carts align with elements five,
> From their fusion, fiery life does thrive.
> Beast heads roar as they swiftly race,
> Fire wheels east and west, the path they trace.

At Flaming Mountains, Red Boy was about to celebrate his hundredth
birthday. He was in high spirits and asked the Keeper, "My birthday is
coming soon. Can I go out and play for a while?"

The Keeper replied, "As your father instructed when he ordered me to
watch over you, I must ensure you focus on your practice. You cannot go
out at will."

Red Boy argued, "1 have already mastered the Samadhi Fire. Can't I take a
break for a few days?" As he spoke, he punched his nose, releasing a burst
of flames.

The Keeper shook his head, "You were taught the Samadhi Fire so that you
could use it to refine your inner core. Spitting fire carelessly such as that
dissipates your qi and is nothing more than a trivial trick."

He continued, "The liver corresponds to wood, which generates fire; the
heart corresponds to fire, which generates earth; the spleen corresponds
to earth, which generates metal; the lungs correspond to metal, which
generates water; the kidneys correspond to water, which generates wood.
The five elements generate each other in a continuous cycle. With the
Samadhi Fire, you should use it to refine the energy of your five organs."

Growing impatient, Red Boy said, "Enough, I understand. 1'll go back to
my practice."

On his birthday, the Bull King hosted a grand banquet in the mountains,
inviting many friends to celebrate. Red Boy ordered some minions to bring
out five small carts. The minions arranged the carts according to the five
elements: gold, wood, water, fire, and earth. Red Boy approached them,
recited an incantation, and spat out fire from his mouth while thick smoke
erupted from his nose. Flames burst forth from his eyes, and fire surged
from the five carts. After several bursts, the red flames blazed into the sky.

The Keeper was displeased, feeling that Red Boy was too playful and
overly interested in trivial tricks. He feared that the boy might waste his
potential in the days to come.

However, the Bull King was very pleased. To him, although Red Boy was
not engaged in deep practice, he already understood how to employ his
skills to create useful tools, which showed great ingenuity. He
immediately ordered the creation of five larger war carts for his son.

From then on, the Five Element Carts became Red Boy's companions in his
practice. Within a hundred years, these carts, imbued with his Samadhi
Fire, gained sentience and became formidable guais in the Flaming
Mountains.
