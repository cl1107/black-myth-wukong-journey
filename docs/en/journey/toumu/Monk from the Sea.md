# Monk from the Sea

> Bitter Lake's expanse, no end in sight,
> The ferry of enlightenment, he sought day and night.
> Low means may tempt, but yield no gain,
> True greatness takes flight, in honor's domain.

Years ago, Yellowbrow crossed the Bitter Lake on a towered ferry. Upon
disembarking, he discovered some strange fish clinging to the ship's hull.
These fish, known as He Luo, had a single head but ten bodies, making
them bizarre and fearsome.

When the fish saw Yellowbrow approaching, they wondrously bowed and
made noises, indicating their desire to follow him and escape the Bitter
Lake. Yellowbrow laughed and said, "With your strange forms, others
would surely reject you. But I find it interesting to take in what ordinary
people would not." With that, he accepted these strange fish as his
disciples, clothed them, and taught them how to read and transform into
human forms. He even allowed them to practice freely within the realm of
the New West.

One of the fish guais was particularly robust and had a fierce
temperament. After mastering some techniques, it would ambush at
various spots in the temple, waiting for opportunities to attack
Yellowbrow when he went out, striking without mercy. Yellowbrow,
however, enjoyed these encounters and would seriously engage in
combat with the fish guai. Most of the time, he would simply sweep it out
of the hall with a swing of his Spikeshaft Cudgel.

Despite repeated defeats, the fish guai realized that close combat was
futile. It independently devised a technique involving throwing snowballs
with its limbs, hitting targets with uncanny accuracy. Once, in the Forest
of Felicity, even Yellowbrow was hit several times by snowballs, nearly
freezing into an ice block.

Instead of getting angry, Yellowbrow was delighted and unprecedentedly
bestowed a new title upon the He Luo fish guai"Monk from the Sea." He
then assigned it the task of cleaning the inner courtyard, which
conveniently allowed it to ambush anyone it wished to, especially
Yellowbrow himself.

Ah, though they followed the same master, the disciples' experiences and
purposes in their practice varied greatly, leading to vastly different
treatments.
