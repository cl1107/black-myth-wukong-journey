# Feng-Tail General

> Fiery tails upon its forehead,
> Preying by the mountainside.
> The skilled one shuns the wars it dreads,
> The unskilled roars with reckless pride.

The Sage Stone Monkey, with his inherent wisdom, learned the ways of
human manners and speech during his travels across various realms and
later achieved mastery of the Dao at Mount Lingtai. Setting aside his
natural endowments, let us now examine his later pursuits in
enlightenment.

When he left in a huff at Yingchou Stream, the Old Loong King reasoned
with him, and he returned to admit his mistakes. He abandoned arbitrary
actions and always heeded sound advice.

He forged brotherly bonds with yaoguais, engaged in jest with immortals,
and exchanged banter with Bodhisattvas. His amiable nature endeared
him to all, who were ever willing to offer their assistance. He had a sense
of decorum and propriety.

He had the ability to summon wind and rain and could seek out loongs. He
could transform into guais for scouting or borrow vessels when needed.
In times of trouble, he sought the aid of higher beings, seldom relying on
brute force.

This Feng-Tail General, with multiple eyes on his head, had a keen
understanding of both himself and his enemies. He was adept at leaping
and dodging, avoiding powerful foes whenever possible, and displayed a
touch of the monkey's cleverness. It's no wonder that the crown on the
monkey's head grasped his nimble thoughts so well.

# Emerald-Armed Mantis

With ruby eyes and jade adorned,
Wielding its blades, fierce and scorned.
When justice falters to show,
An iron fist will strike the blow.

Tang Monk often advocated for kindness, while Sun Kong was known for
his punishment of evil.

At Kui-Mu Wolf's abode, upon learning of the princess's suffering and her
reluctance to leave due to her feelings for the yaoguai and children bore
for him, Sun Wukong ordered Bajie to throw the yaoguai's children from
the height, reducing them to two lumps of flesh.

At Old Yang's house, after learning of the unfilial deeds of the old couple's
son and seeing how they indulged him for the sake of incense offerings, he
proceeded to behead the son despite Old Yang's pleas.

Sun Wukong's nature was to show no mercy to villains and evildoers; he
delighted in eradicating evils and yaoguais. The numerous blood debts on
the journey to the West, though each had its reasons, were mostly
attributed to the monkey.

The world knew of the other three pieces of armor, but they were
unaware that the mantis was actually transformed from the Great Sage's
gauntlet. It seems the gauntlet inherited the Great Sage's ruthlessness, for
it played tricks on Zhu Bajie with the same cunning.
