Long ago, there was a Daoist who dedicated his life to capturing yaoguais.
During one encounter with a frog guai, he traveled far and wide, seeking
their traces. Along the way, he gained many opportunities and became a
highly skilled Daoist. He also came to understand that all beings had their
own ways of survival and were no longer obsessed over capturing
yaoguais. Instead, he grew curious about their lives.

One day, as he passed by Mount Huaguo, he was captivated by the
beautiful scenery and decided to release the tadpole that had
accompanied him on his journey back into the mountain stream.
Unexpectedly, as soon as he let the little frog guai go, several bolts of
lightning struck down, revealing a group of armored celestial soldiers.
The Daoist thought he had caused some trouble and was about to
apologize when the celestial soldiers attacked him without a word. He
quickly drew his sword to defend himself but was gradually overwhelmed
by their numbers. Just as he was about to be seriously injured, a large stone
frog leaped from the riverbank. Unafraid of the flashing blades, and even
the lightning summoned by the soldiers, the stone frog helped the Daoist
fend off his opponents.

The Daoist approached the riverbank and realized that the little frog guai
he had released had brought the stone frog to rescue him. He was deeply
grateful. From that day on, the Daoist no longer aspired to become
immortal. Instead, he frequently visited the frog guais, asking them for
tadpoles to release into various beautiful mountains and rivers. People
began to call him the Frog Immortal.
