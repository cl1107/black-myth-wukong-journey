# Elder Amourworm

> In the celestial garden, rare seeds grow,
> By the Purifying Spring, with an immortal glow.
> Transformed in the lower realm, forms unique,
> Such path to Dao, refined and sleek.

In ancient times, someone cast two celestial eggs from Mount Kunlun into
a blessed land on Earth. However, the Will of the mortal realm was not as
abundant as that of the celestial realm. As a result, the celestial eggs failed
to fully nurture and lost many of their wondrous abilities, taking on vastly
different forms. One of these celestial eggs was used to redeem the guilty,
while the other was hidden away by someone with ulterior motives. From
this hidden egg, various creatures emerged, and it came to be known as
the Elder Amourworm.

Every few days, the Elder Amourworm would produce insect eggs that
resembled blood sacs. If these eggs were ingested by a living being, the
larvae would devour their internal organs. Depending on the innate
differences of the larvae, the host would undergo a transformation,
turning into one of many types of insects.

If the eggs of the Elder Amourworm were not ingested, they would
naturally hatch into an ordinary Amourworm. These ordinary
Amourworm would spin silk to create cocoons, which they used to trap
their prey. The cocoons contained potent toxins that caused the trapped
creatures to experience a sensation of flying in the wind, as if floating on
clouds, instead of feeling suffocated. However, prolonged exposure to
these toxins led to abnormal changes in their bodies over time. Some
practitioners attempted to use this method to temper their bodies and
enhance their powers. However, it was ultimately considered a deviant
practice that easily led to a loss of sanity.

Since the celestial egg entered the mortal world, many have fallen victim
to its poison. The Amourworm, despite its terrifying appearance, is not
adept at combat. Aside from spewing filth from its mouth, it possesses no
remarkable abilities. However, its continued existence and proliferation in
the world suggest that it must provide some unknown benefits to certain
in dividuals.
