# Cloudtreading Deer

> The wind uplifts the noble high,
> While low clouds mark the flesh to die.
> Halt steps in azure skies,
> Or roam where earth's filth lies.

When Sun Wukong was learning the arts at Mount Lingtai, Patriarch
Bodhi not only taught him the seventy-two transformations but also
imparted the "Somersault Cloud" technique. From then on, Wukong's
body became invulnerable, and his movements agile. However, when he
showed off his skills in front of others, the Patriarch foresaw that his lack
of patience would lead to trouble.

Immortals often say that Sun Wukong was at his most mischievous and
ruthless when he was the Monkey King. Yet, during that time, aside from
his battles with the Celestial Court, he rarely harmed other beings. It was
only after he became a disciple, following his master and gaining
direction, that he developed many thunderous methods. Stealing,
robbing, kidnapping, killing, arson, and destroying mountains and caves-
all became second nature to him.

This Cloudtreading Deer is said to be transformed from Sun Wukong's
Lotus Silk Cloudtreaders. It reflects his free-spirited and agile nature but
also harbors his inherent ferocity. Once he falls behind, his true nature is
revealed, and he can no longer maintain his carefree facade.
