# The First Sister

> The path home is covered in green moss,
> Peach blossoms begin to bloom across.
> How tender and gentle, her caring affection,
> Among sisters, a loving connection.

The eldest sister of the Zhu family was gentle and serene, caring for her
younger sisters like a mother. She meticulously managed every aspect of
their daily lives. Even the straightforward second sister and the
independent fourth sister behaved obediently and showed a touch of
girlish charm in her presence. Each day, she oversaw the cave's catering,
everyone's clothing, and was the go-to for disputes, illnesses, joys, and
sorrows, keeping her busy from dawn till dusk.

There was always a steady stream of courier lesser yaoguais coming to her
with messages: "My lady, the second and fourth ladies are arguing." "My
lady, the fifth lady scolded a weaver, and now they need an extra hand.
Can someone be sent?" "My lady, the sixth lady injured herself while
practicing and asks for you to come and have a look."

One day, the lady of the house, her mother, called her to her side. As soon
as she stepped into the hut, the tranquil scene of her mother admiring the
flowers under a tree caught her eyes. Her mother waved her over, saying,
"The flowers in our abode are more beautiful than those in the upper
realm." Meanwhile, outside the hut, the lesser yaoguai in charge of
catering was waiting for her to decide the menu, and the steward
overseeing the cocoons was waiting to report matters...

The eldest sister asked, "Mother, is there something you wish to instruct
me on?"

Her mother gently took her hand and said, "I just want you to accompany
me in admiring these flowers." She smiled warmly, adding, "I worry they
will wear you out." The eldest sister looked at her mother and was
suddenly transported back to many years ago, when her mother had held
her hand in the same way as they admired the peach blossoms together.
The flowers were beautiful then, and so was her mother.
