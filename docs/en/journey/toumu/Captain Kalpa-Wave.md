> Within a flick of the finger, lotus flowers bloom and wither.

Thought yourself mighty, yet ended up headless.
From your blood and pus, lotus flowers bloom restless.
Coaxed, enticed, and stabbed, by the words of auspiciousness,
Your link to Buddha's wisdom severed, your mind lost in the incense dust,
breathless.

The truest of the truth, the kindest in kindness, and the fairest in fairness,
you sought and lost,
Principles shattered, head twisted, and body crossed.
Tenderness forsaken you, your uprights exhaust,
Eyes clouded, stars dimmed in frost.

May your body bring prosperity and
The red lotus thrives in hostility.
