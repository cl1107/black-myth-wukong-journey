# Emerald-Armed Mantis

> With ruby eyes and jade adorned,
> Wielding its blades, fierce and scorned.
> When justice falters to show,
> An iron fist will strike the blow.

Tang Monk often advocated for kindness, while Sun Kong was known for
his punishment of evil.

At Kui-Mu Wolf's abode, upon learning of the princess's suffering and her
reluctance to leave due to her feelings for the yaoguai and children bore
for him, Sun Wukong ordered Bajie to throw the yaoguai's children from
the height, reducing them to two lumps of flesh.

At Old Yang's house, after learning of the unfilial deeds of the old couple's
son and seeing how they indulged him for the sake of incense offerings, he
proceeded to behead the son despite Old Yang's pleas.

Sun Wukong's nature was to show no mercy to villains and evildoers; he
delighted in eradicating evils and yaoguais. The numerous blood debts on
the journey to the West, though each had its reasons, were mostly
attributed to the monkey.

The world knew of the other three pieces of armor, but they were
unaware that the mantis was actually transformed from the Great Sage's
gauntlet. It seems the gauntlet inherited the Great Sage's ruthlessness, for
it played tricks on Zhu Bajie with the same cunning.
