# Guangmou

> With a monk's facade but a serpent's heart,
> He wields deceit, playing many parts.
> His desires shift, insatiably pursued,
> Faithless to his master, all teachings he eschewed.

Guangmou, "the Great Tactician", was not like his senior fellow pupil
Guangzhi. From a young age, His heart yearned to be a legendary yaoguai
master, remembered for ages.

But fate had other plans. When old Lingxuzi sent his beloved disciple to
Guanyin Temple to be a monk, old White Snake Guai grew worried. The
snake feared it was old Lingxuzi's ploy to win favor with the Black Bear
Guai, and commanded Guangmou to join the monkhood as well.

Before he left, the snake warned him: never fall behind, least of all behind
Guangzhi. But no matter how hard Guangmou tried, Elder Jinchi never
seemed to favor him as much as Guangzhi, even when he learned faster
and trained harder. Guangmou consoled himself, believing this stemmed
not from his own failings, but from the snake's ham-fisted meddling,
which had turned the Elder against him. He found solace in the notion of
returning to the mountains one day, when he could embrace his yaoguai
nature, unshackled by such trivial concerns.

Guangmou can still recall Jinchi's teachings: "You can be too extreme, too
uncompromising. Always leave some room and some things unfinished."
But the day Jinchi saw the Kasaya of Eversparks, he desired it so intensely
that he forgot his own words and wept long into the night. Guangmou
saw the thought taking root in the old monk's heart: to kill for this prize.
Everyone shied away from the idea, but Guangzhi boldly spoke the truth.

Guangmou seethed with inexplicable rage. In his mind, a scheme within a
scheme began to take shape. As Elder Jinchi drank tea with the two monks,
Guangmou glimpsed an untamed malice in the monkey's eyesâ€”a hunger
for vengeance. Building on Guangzhi's gambit, Guangmou goaded and
prodded, weaving a merciless plot that left no room for escape. The old
monk was delighted, and for the first time, he acknowledged Guangmou's
wit.

With his plan set, Guangmou knew that doom would strike that night.
Summoning a gust of wind, he hid in the bamboo grove behind the
mountain. As anticipated, a great fire broke out that night. But it failed to
kill the two journeying monks as intended. Instead, it burned the entire
temple to the ground.

Alas, the world harbors such petty souls, capable of ensnaring the lofty
and vanquishing them with cunning plots. Perhaps this is what is meant by
"slaying with a borrowed blade."
