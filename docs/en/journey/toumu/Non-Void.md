# Non-Void

> Neither dead nor truly alive, a dreamer left behind,
> One step missed, cost half a lifetime.

Few disciples know when Non- Void took his vows and became a monk.
They only know that he was among the earliest to follow their master,
making him the most senior, and entrusted to many of the temple's affairs.

He rarely left the hall, seemingly always engrossed in endless sutra
recitations. He was also highly skilled in poetry and painting, having
depicted various Buddhas in the west and the myriad aspects of worldly
life. Yet, he never cherished his creations, often discarding them carelessly
after finishing. When asked why, he would say, "I see no true self; Non-
void is but void. It's all an illusion, so why hold on to it?"

Though Non-Void seldom left the hall, he enjoyed engaging others in
debates about Buddhist doctrines.

One day, Non-Able approached him and asked, "Brother, is killing a sin?"

Non-Void replied, "Killing is a sin. But if it is for the sake of the greater
good, then it is not a sin."

Non-Able countered, "And what is the greater good?"

Non-Void answered, "It is the realization of void, the fulfillment of virtue,
ascending to the land of bliss."

Non-Able questioned further, "Killing not only fails to resolve karma but
also creates more entanglements and obstacles. How can one ascend to
bliss then?"

Non-Void responded, "If I do not enter hell, who will? If not killing leaves
harm for others, isn't that a greater lack of virtue?"

Non-Able laughed, "Brother, you yourself said you would enter hell,
which shows that killing is wrong no matter what. Good ones naturally
receive blessings; there's no need for you to make things complicated."

Non-Void hastily explained, "Entering hell is just a metaphor. The essence
is to suffer for others..."

Non-Able interrupted, "Nonsense! Killing is killing, no need for all these
convoluted justifications. Brother, the pretence behind justifying killing is
the real sin.."

Hearing this, Non-Void was momentarily speechless, as if reminded of
something from the past.

From that day on, the two never debated again.
