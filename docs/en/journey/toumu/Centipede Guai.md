# Centipede Guai

> Twisted in form, it charges like a gale,
> With feet unfurled, it strikes a deadly trail.
> Beware its breath, the venomous embrace,
> In narrow bounds, seek a wider space.

In bygone days, a young man embarked on a journey to the Webbed
Hollow seeking vengeance. However, his quest took a dark turn when he
Was captured by yaoguais and thrown into the Bonevault. Falling into a
deep pit, he landed in a lair of large insects. Despite suffering a broken leg,
he managed to survive. As he looked around, all he could see were
skeletons and remains, filling him with despair.

In the midst of his despair, he felt a sharp pain in his leg. A massive
centipede, as long as a person, had bitten him and torn off a piece of his
flesh to devour. Filled with terror, the young man instinctively grabbed a
stone and viciously crushed the centipede until it burst apart. Only then
did he realize that the stone he used was a human skull, which he quickly
discarded.

To his surprise, he noticed that the pain in his injured leg had subsided.
Curious, he applied some of the centipede's pus to a scraped arm, and the
pain diminished, likely due to the numbing effect of the venom. This
revelation sparked an idea in his mind. He tore strong silk threads from the
cocoons surrounding the pit and found two leg bones to serve as support
for his broken leg.

Exhausted from the ordeal, he rested, but soon heard rustling sounds
around him. He searched for the source of the noise, but it abruptly
ceased. Suddenly, a giant white ball descended from above, bouncing
several times before unfurling into a massive centipede, hundreds of times
larger than the first one. Swiftly, the young man curled himself into a ball,
mimicking the centipede's movements to confuse the colossal creature.

At that moment, more objects fell into the pitâ€”-empty skins and remains.
From them emerged a swarm of smaller centipedes, feasting on the
discarded scraps. They passed by the young man, mistaking him for one of
their own. Realizing this, he began to imitate their behavior, observing
their habits and assimilating into their society. After ten days, he finally
managed to escape the Webbed Hollow.

Basking in the daylight, he came to understand that dwelling on the past
would not allow him to live a fulfilling life. Returning to his hometown, he
sought to lead a peaceful existence. However, the weavers, aware of his
visit to Zhu's Estate, gathered at his doorstep, demanding that he retrieve
treasures from the estate. Forced to hide from them, he found no respite
from the turmoil that surrounded him.
