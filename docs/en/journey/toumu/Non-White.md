# Non-White

> A jester's face with powder white,
> A cunning form, both sly and slight.
> Boldly plays the leading role,
> Yet remains an actor, lost in the whole.

In the Village of Tuoluo, there was a small opera troupe of about a dozen
members. Watching their performances was considered the most
luxurious entertainment within miles.

Among the troupe was an actor who specialized in playing the jester. He
always painted his face white, and the villagers would snicker whenever
they saw him. The jester was deeply frustrated. Since childhood, he had
dreamed of playing a heroic role on stage. To join the troupe, he had
worked as an unpaid servant for the troupe leader for a year. He trained
tirelessly, regardless of the weather or his health. Yet, he ended up being
the subject of ridicule.

The jester suggested a role switch. However, everyone said he lacked the
righteous aura needed for such a heroic role.
Disbelieving their words, the jester took on the role of the hero without
notifying the cast during the performance, and beat up the hero on stage.
The audience was furious; they destroyed the stage and left without
paying.

The jester was condemned by the troupe, while the beaten hero was
comforted. In a fit of rage, the troupe leader expelled the jester from the
group. Despite much reflection, the jester couldn't understand why he
suffered such reprimand. Eventually, he concluded that it was his
appearance that was the problem. Thus, with two poisoned daggers, he
waited in an alley and killed the hero actor. He peeled the man's face and
wore it, hoping to take over his life.

The next day, when it was time for the hero to appear on stage, the jester,
wearing the actor's face, stepped forward and sang passionately.
Initially, the audience was deceived, but later they were horrified.
Believing the jester had gone mad, they tied him up and sent him to a
temple a thousand miles away for seclusion. Upon seeing him, the abbot of
the temple was overjoyed. He named the jester "Non- White" and even
created a unique practicing technique combining poison and frost for
him.

The abbot told him that a Destined One would come and help him master
the technique, and he could become a true hero if he could wear the face
of the Destined One.

From the day on, no one dared to walk the mountain path guarded by
Non-White, fearing they might encounter him wearing someone else's
face.
