# Son of Stones

> A young stone dwelling by mountainside,
> From deep within, where wonders hide.
> With hidden gifts that brightly gleam,
> Pure nature's charm within its dreams.

According to celestial laws, mountain deities are forbidden from leaving
their designated mountains without just cause. Should they be found
wandering without reason, they would be dismissed and subjected to
interrogation.

Before the Son of Stones had come of age and was unable to assume the
role of mountain deity, the Mother of Stones was bound to remain at
Yellow Wind Ridge. She had no choice but to send him alone to search for
his father. Fearing for her son's safety on his journey, the Mother of Stones
transferred a considerable portion of her Stone Essence to him before
allowing him to depart.

Unfortunately, as soon as the Son of Stones set out, he went in the
opposite direction of his father. His father headed west, while he went
east, eventually arriving at Mount Huaguo.

At first, he diligently searched every mountain he came upon for signs of
his father. Should he find none, he would proceed to the next. Yet, the
charm and fascination of Mount Huaguo enticed him to stay.

If queried about his greatest delight, it would certainly be the cricket
known as Feng-Tail General. Daily, he would sit upon the mountain,
watching the cricket's soaring leapsing landings, applauding
with great pleasure. Gradually, he forgot entirely about his quest to find
his father.
