Years ago, in mountains remote, there was a small temple built by the local
villagers. The temple was unattended, housing only a black statue, with
dried lamps and an empty censer.

One day, a wandering swordsman passed by and decided to spend the
night in the temple before continuing his journey. As he was drifting off to
sleep, he suddenly heard the sound of wind behind him. Opening his eyes
slightly, he saw the statue on the altar sprout wings and take flight. The
creature had scythe-like claws on its feet. Terrified, the swordsman
quickly rolled over, drew his sword, and engaged in a fierce battle with the
statue, eventually slaying it.

The next morning, the villagers gathered outside the temple, bringing
flowers and wine to thank the swordsman for ridding them of the yaoguai.
They explained that many such temples in the mountains were inhabited
by these yaoguai disguised as statues and asked the swordsman to
eliminate them all. Seeing the villagers had brought a great deal of silver,
greed overtook him, and he agreed, asking them to lead the way.

Surrounded by the villagers, who praised and urged him on, the
swordsman was led deep into the forest to a larger ancient temple. As soon
as he entered the hall, he saw incense burning high and candles glowing
brightly. On the altar sat a larger statue, similar in appearance to the one
he had killed before, but coated in gold, with a particularly majestic and
imposing presence. Sensing danger, the swordsman tried to flee, but the
statue took flight, flapping its wings to unleash a frosty wind that froze
him in place.

Watching the golden statue used its hooked claws to pierce the
swordsman's shoulders and drag him into the back of the temple, the
villagers all knelt and made their wishes. The next day, everything they
had wished for appeared at their doorsteps.
