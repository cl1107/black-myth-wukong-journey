# The Second Sister

> With powdered face and hair in a twist,
> A slender waist adorned with jade amidst.
> As charming as a maiden from the skies,
> Yet most formidable when she vies.

The second daughter of the Zhu family was raised as a boy from a young
age. She managed the finances and trade for the cave. Due to her
straightforward and generous nature, she had the most interactions with
the stewards outside the mountain and the lesser yaoguais in the Village of
Lanxi.

Because she was busy with numerous affairs, the lesser yaoguais had fixed
times to report and offer tributes to her. Most of these yaoguais, who were
on good terms with her, both respected and feared her. They believed that
their capable and strong-willed lady might one day become the lady of the
cave. If that happened, anyone fortunate enough to marry into the family
could become a lord by association. This caused much distress for the four
scorpion princes residing in the cave, who were often the subject of idle
gossip.

The second sister paid no mind to such rumors. Among the four sons of
the Scorpionlord, she favored only those who were the most helpful to
her.

A few days ago, she had acquired a celestial vine seed from somewhere and
planted it in her private courtyard within the cave, assigning the eldest
scorpion prince to guard it.

The eldest scorpion prince, delighted, assumed this meant the second
sister had feelings for him. One day, he approached the Hundred-Eyed
Daoist Master, asking for help in matchmaking. The master laughed and
shook his head, saying that a woman with such a strong will would only
look down on him more if he sought someone else's help in proposing. He
advised the prince to come up with a plan on his own.

After returning to the cave, the eldest scorpion prince circled the celestial
vine repeatedly, but he still hadn't figured out a way to win her heart.
