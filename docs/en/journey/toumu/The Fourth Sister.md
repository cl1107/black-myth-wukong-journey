# The Fourth Sister

> Sword raised to the azure sky,
> Enemy blood stains the black robe high.
> Fortunate to be a maiden fair,
> Outshining heroes with grace and flair.

In the old days, the Scorpionlord brought his four sons to the Temple of
Yellow Flowers, seeking refuge. The Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master,
coveting the power of his venom, promised to arrange marriages between
the young spider yaoguais and the scorpion princes. Hence, he called
forth Violet Spider and four of her daughters to meet them.

Once everyone was seated, the Daoist Master asked the princes to
introduce themselves one by one.

The eldest prince stood up, thumping his chest, and declared, "My skills
were personally taught by my father. Among my brothers, I am the best
bachelor. If all the sisters wish to marry me, don't let it cause any discord."

Seeing the sisters frown, the second prince quickly stood up and
interjected, "Sisters, please forgive my brother's recklessness. Strong as he
is, which I admit, I am no less capable. If you choose me as your husband, I
will expand our domain and make it prosperous."

The Daoist Master was displeased by the second prince's ambition, and the
sisters too remained non-committal, turning their gaze to the third
scorpion son. Feeling the pressure of their stares, he reluctantly said,"My
brothers are all skilled, and my younger brother is also exceptional. Sisters,
please consider carefully before making a choice."

The fourth prince, disdainful of his third brother's lack of confidence,
said, "My third brother is a bit awkward in temperament. I hope you don't
mind. Although I am younger, my future is promising. Choosing me is
choosing the future."

After hearing their self-introductions, the Daoist master asked the four
daughters of the Zhu family to express their opinions one by one. The
eldest sister spoke gently, "With many sisters to look after, and our
mother's illness, I cannot lay down this burden and let my sisters suffer.
My marriage can wait a few more years."

The scorpions shook their heads, expressing regret. The second sister
laughed coquettishly and said, "I am busy managing the family business
alone, with many financial gaps to fill. If any of you are willing to help
bridge these gaps, I might consider marriage."

The Scorpionlord's mountain had long since fallen into ruin, with no
wealth to speak of, so the second sister's words effectively ended the
conversation. The third sister, holding a fan, said, "I wish to marry
someone with whom I can live in harmony. I love the poetry of Luo Yin.
Have any of you read his works?"

It's likely that the four princes didn't even know what poetry was, let
alone who Luo Yin was. Consequently, everyone pinned their hopes on
the fourth sister.

Sitting at the end, the fourth sister hummed softly out ofboredom before
speaking. "My sisters, you were too polite, speaking so tactfully that they
probably didn't even understand. This so-called meeting is just a scheme
against us. We would end up with no gain, while they take our dowries
and positions in our cave. How dare they consider us as the ones to be
taken advantage of? They call themselves princes, yet none of them are
noble. If they truly had any skills, why not earn their own fortunes instead
of showing off and making fools of themselves here?"

After the fourth sister's outburst, the conversation at the table shifted to
criticizing her. Though apologies were exchanged, the topic of marriage
was never brought up again.
