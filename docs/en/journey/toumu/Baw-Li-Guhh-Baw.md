Continuing from the previous story, the Daoist was rescued from the cold
pond by monks who carried him into the mountains. He initially expected
them to take him to a temple for healing, but to his surprise, they threw
him into a dungeon.

In the dungeon, he endured beguiling chants, suffered from red eyes, and
narrowly escaped death multiple times. Despite the hardships, his martial
skills improved significantly, which he considered a fortunate turn of
events. When he finally returned to the original spot, the frog was
nowhere to be found. He left the New West and continued his journey.

One sunny day, the Daoist arrived at a ridge covered in lush greenery, with
a few thatched huts indicating habitation. Seeking a place to rest, he
stepped into a large courtyard but accidentally fell into a hole.
Inside, he found layers of spider webs and insect guais everywhere.
Fortunately, he was no longer as helpless as before and managed to
navigate deeper into the cave. The tadpoles he had been nurturing in his
gourd suddenly became lively.

He squeezed through a stone crevice and saw a large crimson-skinned
frog occupying a natural spring, with insect guais keeping their distance.
Drawing his sword, he attacked the frog. They fought fiercely in the water,
one emitting crackling electricity, the other thrashing its limbs
powerfully. As they reached a stalemate, the frog opened its mouth and
extended a left hand from within, striking the Daoist's face and sending
him aback. The frog then tilted its head back, and the Daoist, having
learned his lesson, dared not approach. The frog spewed poisonous water,
which spread and contaminated the entire pond.

The Daoist hadn't anticipated this ability and, lacking any antidote,
hurriedly retreated through the stone crevice. As he did, he heard a female
voice behind him, "Daoist, why aren't you practicing your swordsmanship
at the temple? Are you here to seek death?"

Poisoned and unable to respond, he collapsed into the muddy pond. In his
hazy state, he heard the woman call for help, "Quick, carry him back to the
temple. We can't let him die here; it would be hard to explain."
