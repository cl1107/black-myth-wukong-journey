This story was told by a pharmacist in the city, and it concerns a secret
about his cousin's family.

The cousin's ancestors were originally ginseng gatherers in the
mountains. For some unknown reason, they abandoned their old craft and
became woodcutters.

Although the family was not wealthy, everyone lived long lives.
From a young age, the cousin often saw a shabby, unkempt old man
visiting their home. Whenever he came, the family would prepare a lavish
meal and fine wine for him to enjoy alone. At the time, the cousin despised
the old man, thinking he was a freeloading drunkard who seldom spoke
and often caused trouble when drunk.

One day, the old man visited again for a drink while the cousin's great-
grandmother fell gravely ill with typhoid fever, seemingly on the brink of
death. Upon hearing about her critical condition, the old man went into
the courtyard, reached into the ground with both hands, and out crawled
numerous vines. Among the vines grew a small seedling that quickly
matured, blossomed, and bore fruit. The old man pulled it out, revealing a
Millennium Ginseng. After the great-grandmother drank the ginseng
soup, she miraculously recovered and remains healthy to this day.

It was on that day that the cousin seemed to come to a realization and
began to treat the old man with great respect, as if he were a member of
the family.

The cousin once invited the pharmacist to move to the mountains and live
with him, but the pharmacist flatly refused.

The pharmacist explained,"Although your family enjoys longevity, they
live on bland meals every day, and life in deep mountains are too lonely. I
still prefer to live in the city. Hence, I cannot go with you."

Just take the story as a fun anecdote.
