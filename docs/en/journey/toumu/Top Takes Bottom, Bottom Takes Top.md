# Top Takes Bottom, Bottom Takes Top

> Rolling in the haze, many lives they ensnare.

This story was told by Minster Xu.

Years ago, Xu, dissatisfied with his wife's strict adherence to propriety and
her lack of warmth in the chamber, took a fiery and beautiful concubine.

This concubine had a terrible temper, often bossing Xu around and
showing no respect for the lady of the house. If anyone tried to talk her
into adhering to manners and propriety, she would laugh and curse them
until they left in disgrace. Yet, Xu found this amusing and indulged her in
every way, spoiling her with affection.

One day, Xu was returning to the capital to report on his duties. Fearing
that their carriage might be attacked by bandits, he hired a large boat to
transport his family, servants, and belongings back to the capital. That
night, the sound of fighting suddenly erupted on the boat. It turned out
that a yaoguai had sneaked aboard under the cover of darkness. Soon, a
terrifying figure with horns and jagged teeth appeared. He wore a tattered
cloth around his waist, held a pot-shaped shield in his left hand, and
wielded an iron whip in his right, glaring menacingly at everyone.

Xu and his wife trembled in fear, but the concubine stood tall and
unafraid, loudly scolding the yaoguai for his rudeness. The yaoguai was
taken aback for a moment, then sighed and said, "Even in human form,
you are so arrogant. Truly, you are one of us, a Yaksha."

The concubine burst into laughter and said, "Nonsense! I intended to play
for a while longer, but now you've ruined everything. Fine, let's kill them
all and leave together." With that, she transformed into a creature
identical to the yaoguai.

Xu finally realized that he had brought a yaoguai into his home.

Just as the two yaoguais were about to kill Xu and his family, a female voice
rang out, "Even though the your kingdom has fallen and you were forced
to seek shelter in the east, you should not behave so rudely. Why not
follow me into the mountains for your practice?" Just when the two
yaoguais were ready to resist, a woman descended onto the bow of the
boat, holding a precious fan. With a powerful wave of the fan, she
immobilized them in the wind.

After this terrifying experience, Xu never dared to take another concubine.
