# Guangzhi

> To prove his worth, he gave sinister advice,
> Yet reaped the bitter fruits of his own vice.
> Though justice remains silent, it never sleeps,
> And when it strikes, no one escapes its reach.

In his youth, Guangzhi was not a monk but a little wolf guai who yearned
to be human.

He often took human shape to play in town, but the people always saw
through him and chased him away. When he asked the other yaoguais
why, they explained, "You may look like them, but you don't act like them.
That's why they know. If you want to learn to be human, go live among
them. Spend time with them to learn their ways and manners." He took
this advice to heart and begged his master to grant this wish. His master,
old Lingxuzi, who was close to the Black Bear Guai in the mountain,
agreed. The Black Bear Guai transformed the pup into a little monk and
sent him to study under Elder Jinchi, an old friend.

At first, the fellow monks disliked him. They played tricks on him, and he
always fell for it, slow and gullible as he was. Jinchi named him Guangzhi,
"the Great Wisdom", hoping he would grow clever and sharp, so his
fellow monks couldn't bully him. With Jinchi's care and teaching,
Guangzhi learned to read, write, and abide by the monastic rules.
Gradually, he assimilated into their ranks.

One day, two monks arrived at the temple. One had a fair, devout
countenance, while the other had a face covered in fur. They possessed a
wondrous treasure: the Kasaya of Eversparks. Jinchi had never seen
anything like it before and longed for it desperately. Hoping to repay
Jinchi's teachings and nurturing, Guangzhi devised a plan to acquire it for
him.

Guangzhi never imagined his mistake would ignite red tides of flames that
engulfed the temple he called home. Afterward, Jinchi took his own life,
and Lingxuzi fell to the Jingubang. Even the Black Bear Guai surrendered
and was taken by Guanyin. Guangzhi saw how many had suffered for his
sake, and knew he had failed utterly at being human. He shed his monk
robes and retreated to the mountains, repenting with Jinchi's teachings.

In his years of practice in the mountains, he forged a new weapon inspired
by the raging flames he saw that night. He named it "the Red Tides". Even
to this day, after numerous years, he continues to hear a persistent call
echoing through the mountains: "Guangzhi, Guangzhi!" Who could it be
that keeps calling him?
