# Non-Able

> Amidst the snow, a monk so strange,
> Before the wall, in northern winds' range.
> With martial arts, he seeks true Zen,
> Bind his hands, but not his spirit then.

Non-Able was unmatched in his martial arts skills, with no one in the
temple able to rival him.

One day, Yellowbrow summoned him and offered to teach him some
skills. However, Non-Able replied, "Master, I believe my martial arts are
sufficient to overcome any foe. There is no need for other skills."

Yellowbrow laughed and said, "Your straightforward approach shows a
lack of adaptability. How can you progress further if you bind yourself in
such a way?"

Non-Able responded, "Master, if I use methods I do not believe in to
achieve victory, even if I win in the end, I will still feel like I did not win
the fight and unable."

Yellowbrow asked,"Do you not agree with your master's path?"
Non-Able replied, "Master, you have always taken the clever route, which
is why it is difficult for you to attain Buddhahood. It seems you can do
everything, but in reality, you can do nothing."

Non-Able chuckled softly at this and ordered Non-Able hands to be tied
behind his back, instructing him to reflect on his actions in front of the
stone wall outside the temple. He thought that after a few days of
kneeling, Non-Able would let go of his stubbornness. However, Non-Able
remained resolute and, to this day, refuses to bow his head.
