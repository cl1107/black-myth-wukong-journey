# Gold Armored Rhino

> With thunderous horns and armor of gold so bright,
> One can charge forth, the ground quaking with might.
> A form of strength, no evil dares draw near,
> An unyielding heart, forever held dear.

It was well known that Sun Wukong, after being tempered in Lord Lao's
Furnace, acquired a heart of gold, lungs of silver, a head of copper, and an
iron body. Yet, what many might not realize is that even his seemingly
invulnerable body still could feel pain when injured.

He was pinned beneath the mountain for five hundred years, with no visits
from his underlings, sustained only by the mountain deities and keepers
who provided him with iron pellets and molten copper. He suffered
injuries from the Samadhi Wind at Yellow Wind Ridge, was trapped in the
transforming gourd of the Gold and Silver Horn brothers at Flat Top
Mountain, scorched unconscious by the Samadhi Fire at Withered Pine
Stream, beheaded in the Kingdom of Chechi, stung on the head by the
Scorpion Guai in Pipa Cave, imprisoned within the golden cymbal in the
New West, captured in the golden light trap at the Temple of Yellow
Flowers, had his heart gouged out in the Kingdom of Bhikku, and endured
the tightening headband curse numerous times, each instance squeezing
his head until it almost resembled a gourd.

Through bodily harm and mental torment, only he could guide the rest of
the journeyers to the foot of Mount Lingshan. If the Golden Armored
Rhino was truly transformed from the Great Sage's golden armor as they
say, it indeed mirrored the Great Sage's indomitable spirit, never yielding
to defeat. Even if its horn was shattered, it never lost the resolve to charge
into battle, standing resolute and ready to fight anew.
