A young man from the Village of Shaded Heights served at the county
yamen, running errands for the local government. The magistrate
despised him and hindered his advances at every turn. One day, the
magistrate learned of a yaoguai haunting the Village of Lanxi. He sent the
young man to investigate alone and hoped he'd never return. Aware of the
magistrate's ill intent, the young man accepted the task without
hesitation; he chose not to beg for his life in this. As he entered the
desolate, eerie village, he was overcome with regret. But as night fell and
without knowledge of the mountain paths, he had no choice but to stay.

He found a less dilapidated house with intact eaves, barred all doors and
windows, and lit a lamp to steel himself for a long night, planning to
depart at first light. Fear gripped him at midnight, so he practiced his
swordplay to calm his nerves. After a while, a deep voice arose from the
darkness above the rafters: "I am a yaoguai of this ridge. I meant to kill you,
but with your fine swordsmanship and the official blade, you must be a
yamen runner, yes?"

The young man was startled but needed to voice his woes. He shared his
ordeal with the yaoguai and drew sighs of empathy. The yaoguai said, "1,
too, was once an imperial guard, but a treacherous court official cursed
me into a beetle to scrape by in these hills. I long for death, but I still wish
to pass on my sword skills to someone worthy. Now, if you're willing to
learn my skills, I offer to teach you."

The young man dared not to refuse. As he agreed, a beetle, over three
meters tall, descended from the shadows. Its neck bore a thick carapace
like a general's helm. The beetle wielded twin blades with a steadfast and
forceful style that suited the young man's disposition. Overjoyed, the
young man practiced with the beetle by the fading lamplight till dawn. As
they parted ways, the beetle said kindly, "The world these days is full of
those lacking talent and virtue and ascending through flattery. Why
tangle with them and sully yourself? Aim higher-a man should carve his
own path." With a hearty laugh, the beetle left.

This encounter changed the young man. He resigned from his position at
the yamen and enlisted in the border armies. His superb swordsmanship
elevated him to the rank of general. Leading the troops against foreign
foes, he won victory after victory and became a famed commander.
