A young man once lived in the Webbed Hollow. You may wonder how he
found himself living among the yaoguais. The tale begun in the Kingdom
of Zhuzi, where he was born into a family of weavers, their craft passed
down through generations. One day, his father left home in search of a
jade shuttle but never returned. His mother searched for him, only to be
told he had abandoned them to marry into the Zhu family. Consumed by
grief and convinced that a yaoguai had ensnared her husband, she wept
day after day. Thus, in his boyhood, the son vowed to slay the yaoguais and
avenge his father.

Years later, he heard merchants speak of the Zhu's Estate on the Webbed
Ridge, home to women of unearthly beauty. He ventured there alone to
exact vengeance. But as soon as he entered the mountains, lesser yaoguais
captured him. Terrified he was, before a little girl in yellow rescued him by
commanding the yaoguais to stop. The girl, barely ten, had a sweet, rosy
face-hardly an evil yaoguai as he imagined. The young man was at a loss.
To his surprise, the young girl, lonely with few companions her age,
brought him to the Webbed Hollow to play. He stayed, and she visited
often to lift her spirits. Conflicted, he spent nights vowing by lamplight to
slay the yaoguais and avenge his father come morning. One night, a small
wasp flew in and heard his oath, but he paid it no mind.

The next day, the girl didn't come. Instead, a woman in green, adorned
with an elaborate bun and possessing a fierce yet beautiful face, arrived
with an entourage of insect guards. Among them was a wasp yaoguai who,
with practiced ease, deftly searched the young man's trunk, pulling out
his hidden stash of travel money and the dagger intended for murder
hidden within his porcelain pillow, before relaying his nightly vow of
vengeance to its mistress.

The green-clad woman addressed the young man, "No mortal shall reside
in Webbed Hollow, yet we spared you to be a companion for my younger
sister. But, in return, you plot to harm her, and you shall be punished for
this. That being said, your quest for vengeance is understandable; which is
why I shall leave your fate to the Bonevault." At her command, the guards
seized him, casting him into the abyss, his fate uncertain in the darkness
below.
