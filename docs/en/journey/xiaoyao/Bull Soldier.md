# Bull Soldier

> Strong of body, skilled in fight,
> Shield and spear, a valorous sight.
> Heart ablaze with fervent zeal,
> Love's disdain, the pain he feels.

Three centuries ago, when the Bull King still graced the Celestial Court
and the Red Boy practiced under Guanyin, peace reigned over Flaming
Mountains.

One day, Bishui Beast promoted a captain among the bull soldiers, and the
captain moved into the night-duty chamber of the Rakshasa Palace to
accommodate his increased responsibilities.

He occupied the adjoining room for rest and the main west chamber for
hosting guests. One morning, he found the guest room had been tidily
arranged overnight: dustless furniture, washed fruits on plates, and
freshly brewed tea. Perplexed, he thought of the furry celestial maidens
serving the Lady and the fox maidens attending the King's daughter.
Recalling how the other guards often teased him for being more
handsome than the rest, now, as a new captain, he couldn't help but feel
elated-surely, there must be a secret admirer.

For over a month, this mysterious "kind-hearted maiden" visited nightly
yet never revealed herself. Growing impatient, the captain resolved to
wait outside the chamber one night. Around the fourth watch, he heard
heavy steps, quite unlike the gentle maidens, furred or fox. Regardless, he
lunged at the figure as soon as the door opened and secured a tight hold

on it. The figure was muscular and sturdy, too large for his arms. Muffled
grunts followed, and the voice of the Bull Sergeant emerged,"I like things
tidy, and your room is always messy. That's why I'd clean it up after my
night duty. You don't have to act so... grateful..."
