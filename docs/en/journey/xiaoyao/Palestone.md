In a small kingdom west of the Black Wind Mountain, the ageing king
lived in constant fear of his dwindling lifespan. Desperate to find the elixir
of longevity, he embarked on a frantic search for a solution.

One day, an immortalist informed the king that consuming quartz could
extend his life and bestow eternal youth. Upon hearing this, the king
immediately issued a royal decree, commanding his subjects to scour the
lands in search of quartz. Eager to claim their reward, stone miners
ventured deep into the desolate Yellow Wind Ridge. There, they came
across a stone being with an enormous head adorned with a brilliant white
mineral-quartz.

News of the discovery reached the king, who promptly dispatched his
crown prince with an army to collect the precious quartz. Little did they
know that as they ventured into the ridge, they would be enveloped by
swirling dust and relentless yellow winds. Cunning and treacherous, the
stone beings lurked beneath the earth, lying in wait. Whenever someone
approached, they would swarm out in a coordinated ambush, ensnaring
their unsuspecting prey from both sides. The army suffered heavy
casualties before obtaining even a trace of the coveted quartz. In a state of
desperation, a messenger was dispatched to the capital, bearing a plea of
withdrawal that detailed the perilous expedition and the dreadful
calamities befalling the men. However, the aged king remained steadfast
in his resolve, insistent on obtaining a substantial amount of quartz.

Eventually, the crown prince returned with the coveted quartz and an
army halved, and requested to present the precious mineral to his father
in the royal chamber. Seizing the opportunity, he initiated a coup, and
plunged a knife into the king's heart, leaving him to die holding his
cherished quartz of longevity on his bed.
