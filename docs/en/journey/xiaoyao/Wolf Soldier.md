# Wolf Soldier

> From glint of steel, their daily bread.
> Far-flung from their native land,
> At nights, for home, their souls shall stand.

Ever since the black bear guai returned from Guanyin and crowned
himself king, he boasted of the arts he had learned. Tales of his newfound
method of practice and power of revival allured many a guai to Black
Wind Mountain. Seeking the king's favor, these minions toiled with
abandon.

Among them, a wolf guai worked with tireless zeal. He rose before dawn,
patrolled the mountains, and continued well into the night. All of the
treasures he found were first laid at the king's feet. His life was one of
labor, and yet, without a moment to make friends. Despite his dedication,
his presence barely stirred a whisper among the others, and his name was
seldom uttered.

His brother, seeing such unacknowledged dedication, spent his savings for
a seat in the king's lecture. The wolf guai sat there, heavy with regret for
the silver he had squandered, both on the journey here and the seat at the
lecture, that could have been used to buy himself a shield or blade. "Had I
a new blade," he mused, "glory could have been mine."

As he pondered this, golden-clad guardians scattered paper talismans
before him. Commanded to consume them, they then chanted in
meditation for hours until the king sought signs of enlightenment. The
white-robed wolf guai stood first, claiming a fervor within and clarity of
mind.

The diligent wolf guai thought to himself,"Sweating fervently in a crowd
is no marvel... Achieving clarity after chanting is no miracle." Just as he
was lost in thought, the blue ox guai rose next, followed by others. The
diligent wolf guai stayed seated, unsure, until the king gestured for them
all to sit down.

Later, treasures were doled out; the ox guai received a golden pill, the
white-robed wolf guai a title. But the diligent one kept his old shield and
dull blade, patrolling the mountain still. Only from then on, he did it all
under the white-robed one's whims, ever obedient.
