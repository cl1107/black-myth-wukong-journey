A white-robed wolf guai, patrolling the hills, seized a sword from a
traveler. Jewels studded its scabbard, its blade sharp and bright. Coveting
it, he strapped the sword to his side, revelling in its splendor. Yet, when it
was time to give tribute, he hid it away. The other guais chided, "Without
offering such treasures to the king, how will you earn his favor, or do you
fancy patrolling forever?" The wolf guai scoffed, "Such treasures we
cherish, the king barely notices. You offer scrap metal and dream of favor?
You are fools."

They dismissed his words, seeing them as mere excuses to shirk his duty,
while they toiled on. The wolf guai indulged in peaches and drank
wherever he could lay hands on them, keeping the very best for himself.
The others knew his punishment would come, and waited.

One day, the Black Wind King held a lecture on Buddhism in the
mountains, speaking of enlightenment and revival. His guardians spread
paper talismans, and all were commanded to consume them before the
chanting and prayers. Hours later, the king inquired about their
enlightenment. A pause fell; then, the white-robed wolf guai stood, and
there emerged others, one by one.

The next day, a decree was issued to the guardians: the wolf guai was
promoted to a minor captain. All the other guais, puzzled, whispered
among themselves. How had the wolf guai not only escaped punishment
but found himself rewarded?
