In the Kingdom of Zhuzi, a woman gave birth to a two-headed child,
causing great horror throughout the cities.

People lamented the unfortunate fate of the woman and her child,
predicting that the child would be difficult to raise. Contrary to their
expectations, the child not only survived past infancy but also grew
stronger and healthier than most others. The folks then again speculated
that while the child might grow up, he would surely be a fool. However, as
the child matured, he proved to be quite intelligent. His two heads gave
him a unique perspective, allowing him to come up with ideas that others
couldn't.

Disappointed by their failed predictions, the folks declared the child to be
an ill omen, foretelling future disasters. The constant rumors eventually
drove the two-headed youth to leave his hometown.

Years later, a beetle with a stone-carved Buddha head attacked the border
of the Kingdom of Sahali. The king dispatched his army to defend the city,
but they suffered repeated defeats. Morale plummeted, and as thoughts of
retreat began to plague the soldiers' hearts, a tall, two-headed man in the
army stood out and volunteered to lead an elite squad in a raid against the
yaoguai.

On the day of the battle, he arranged his elite soldiers in a line. When the
yaoguai attacked, they threw coal dust on it and then sprayed strong
liquor from their mouths to create pillars of fire that detonated the coal
dust. Terrified by the fire, the yaoguai quickly withdrew into the desert.

Seeing that this tactic could temporarily repel the yaoguai, the King was
greatly relieved and appointed the two-headed man as a captain. Learning
that his children were also two-headed, the king decreed that the position
of captain would be hereditary in his family, encouraging his children to
join the army and strengthen the forces. One can only wonder what the
folks from his hometown would say upon hearing such news.
