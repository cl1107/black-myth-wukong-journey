On Mount Kunlun, there exists a creature called the "Tuluo." It resembles
a sheep but has four horns and is known to devour humans. Another
creature, known as the "Qinyuan," looks like a bee but is as large as a
mandarin duck. Its sting is lethal to birds and beasts, and it can wither
trees with a mere touch of its venom.

King Mu of Zhou once had the fortune to visit Mount Kunlun. He toured
its magnificent palaces, tasted various celestial herbs and delicacies,
listened to sweet music performed by beautiful celestial maidens, and saw
many wondrous mythical beasts.

When the celestial maidens presented gifts to King Mu, he refused but
pointed to the mythical beasts in garden and asked, "May I take one of
these extraordinary creatures back with me?" The celestial maidens
replied, "The beings of Kunlun drink from the celestial moat and feed on
celestial herbs. Even if you take them to the mortal realm, they would lose
their form and abilities. It is better not to take them away, for if they
transform, we cannot predict what calamities they might cause."
