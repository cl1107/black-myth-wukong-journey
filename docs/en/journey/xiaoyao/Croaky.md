Two frog guais practiced in the marshes. The smaller frog was often
bullied, yet the bigger one always stood up for him, and soon they forged a
strong friendship. One day, amid a contest held by Baw- Li-Guhh- Lang to
appoint a sergeant among all the frogs, turmoil stirred and rippled
through the ranks. Finally, the choice was narrowed down to the two, the
brawny big frog and the quick-witted small frog. Though the other frogs
were discontented, they dared not voice their dissent.

The two then were assigned to guard the dwelling of Baw-Li-Guhh-Lang.
On their duty, a valuable amber glass was found broken. Unable to identify
the culprit, all the frogs began clamoring for punishment against the two
instead. The big frog attempted to reason with them but got antagonized
by their words and soon escalated the argument into a brawl. The frogs
interpreted this as his reaction out of embarrassment, hence evidence of
his guilt. The small frog, meanwhile, remained silent beside them. Seeing
this, the big frog chided him for not speaking up in his defense and even
began to suspect his smaller companion.

Hesitated for a while, the small frog then admitted to breaking the glass.
However, the other frogs dismissed his confession, arguing that one of
them had committed premeditated vandalization while the other had
neglected his duty, and both deserved punishment by death. The small
frog grew anxious and could not help but engage in the argument. As their

voice grew louder and louder, their bellies inflated larger and larger, until
some of them finally burst, splattering blood and flesh all over the place,
leaving none unsoiled.
