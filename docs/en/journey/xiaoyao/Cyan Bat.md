In the past, there was a butcher named Wang in Changuang Village.
Orphaned at a young age, his mother couldn't support him, so she sent
him to apprentice with a butcher at the foot of the mountain, where he
honed his skills.

One day, a wealthy family in town was celebrating a birthday and invited
Wang to slaughter pigs and sheep. Pleased with his work, the host
rewarded him with a leg of pork. Wang decided to bring the pork leg back
to his mother and set off for the village that night. Halfway there, he saw a
man by the roadside, holding a hunting spear and wearing an old cloth
shirt. The man called out, "Brother, I'm a hunter from the village, trapping
rabbits down this slope. I'm afraid of ghosts at night; may I walk with
you?"

Wang nodded in agreement, and they continued on their way. After a
while, the hunter started a conversation, "Brother, have you heard? There
have been reports of yaoguais on this mountain path recently." Wang
laughed, "What's there to fear about yaoguais? I have a butcher's knife at
my waist and a pork leg on my shoulder. If I encounter a yaoguai, I'll swing
the pork leg at it and chop it with my knife." The hunter forced a smile.
After walking a bit further, the hunter said, "Brother, you must be very
skilled if you're not afraid of yaoguais." Wang laughed again, "I've been
slaughtering animals since I was a child. One strike can hit the vital spot,
and one chop can break bones and tendons." The hunter, annoyed, said,
"How can you compare yaoguais to animals?" Wang replied seriously,
"There are no yaoguais in this world. Those who uphold justice are heroes;
those who bully the innocent are simply foul beasts." The hunter, unsure
how to respond, walked on in silence.

As the village came into view, the hunter hesitated and said, "Since you're
not afraid, why not turn around and look at me?" Wang had already
suspected the hunter was a yaoguai. He swung the pork leg, knocking the
hunter to the ground, and raised his knife to strike. The yaoguai, losing its
composure, quickly spread its wings and flew into the air, spitting, "Today
I met a tough one, bad luck, bad luck!" With that, it fled immediately.

Ah, they say the soft persimmons are easier to squeeze, hence it's better to
be strong. Stand firm, and even yaoguais will fear you a bit.
