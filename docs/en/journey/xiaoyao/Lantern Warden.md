The ancient temple on the mountain peak, weathered by the passage of
time, had gradually fallen into disrepair. When the abbot returned after
many years and saw the temple in such a state of ruin, he was filled with
sorrow. Determined to restore the temple to its former glory, he spent a
large amount of gold and silver to fund it reconstruction, hoping to
showcase his path to the ultimate bliss.

The abbot selected a towering forest in the mountains, intending to use
the ancient trees there as beams for the new temple. The craftsmen
responsible for the timber set up their shelters at the edge of the forest and
began felling trees according to the abbot's instructions.

Everything proceeded smoothly, and within half a year, all the necessary
timber was prepared. The craftsmen received their wages and packed up,
ready to descend the mountain the next day.

That night, a craftsman on night watch was patrolling the area, carrying a
lantern. Suddenly, rustling sounds from the forest set his nerves on edge.
Terrified, he woke everyone up. With their lanterns lit, and axes in hand,
all the craftsmen treaded into the forest to locate the source of the sound.
As they ventured deeper into the forest, someone let out a scream and was
abruptly dragged into the darkness along with his lantern by an unknown
force. Then, one by one, despite their attempts to hide and flee, all
craftsmen were all dragged away. Only one clever craftsman quickly
extinguished his lantern. Trembling with fear, he groped his way through
the forest. Fortunately, a faint light appeared in the distanceâ€”the sun was
about to rise.

With this faint light, he found his way back and hurried towards the
shelters. As he reached the edge of the forest, the sunlight suddenly
became blindingly bright, filling his eyes with a white glare. Enduring the
pain, he looked closer and realized the light was not from the rising sun
but from his companions' lanterns. These lanterns were held up by vines
that had replaced his companions' heads, propping up their corpses.
A chubby boy with a pale face, dressed in a yellow robe, rode a tall four-
legged beast whose head emitted strange sounds. Just as the craftsman
was about to plead for mercy, he felt a chill on his back. Then, he felt
himself being lifted higher and higher until he was level with the lanterns.
The chubby child patted the beast's head, the sounds ceased, the lanterns
went out, and the night returned to its eerie stillness.

The chubby boy laughed and said, "Good materials should be used to their
fullest."
