# Yaksha Archer

> The bow's stark snap doth kindle fright,
> The arrow's tip doth chaos incite.
> Blind eyes traded for an enlightened heart,
> Fate's ear deaf to a beneficent start.

In the past, the Yaksha King was betrayed by the celestial beings, leading
to the massacre of the royal family and the downfall of the Yaksha
Kingdom. After the kingdom's collapse, the yakshas were forced into exile.
The ceremonial archers, who once guarded the royal entourage, clung to
their former glory and refused to shed their ornate armor. Despite their
exceptional archery skills, their slow shooting speed and lack of close
combat prowess made their exile particularly harsh.

Due to their inadequate strength, they resorted to ambushes from the
shadows. The abbot assigned them to the Pagoda Realm for rigorous
training. They endured daily torment there, especially when the Mani
Wheel played its beguiling chants, driving everyone mad. During these
times, the Blade Monks would seize the opportunity to behead the archers
with their large blades, leaving the yaksha archers desperate for a way to
fight back.

They sought guidance from various sources and frequently challenged the
Blade Monks, only to be defeated repeatedly. One day, some blind monks
came to oversee the Pagoda Realm. They had blinded themselves to
pursue the path to ultimate bliss, yet their martial arts were incredibly
refined. The yaksha archers asked for their advice, and the monks replied,
"Aim too carefully and you will lose the initiative. Learn from me; gouge
out your eyes, and you will shoot from the heart, never missing your
mark."

With the only other option available to them being annihilation, the
archers adopted this drastic measure, gouging out their eyes. After this,
the Blade Monks rarely targeted them. When asked why, a Blade Monk
replied, "Who would want to go up against a madman? It's safer to just
find another opponent."
