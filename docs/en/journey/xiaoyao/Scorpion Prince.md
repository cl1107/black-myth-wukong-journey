# Scorpion Prince

> Silent it hides, with venomous claws,
> Barbed hooks laced with deadly flaws.
> It arrives with a fierce, bold show,
> But in defeat, it tucks tail and goes.

The four sons of the Scorpion House often secretly inquired about each
other's recent activities. This was not out of brotherly affection but rather
due to a competitive spirit, fearing that one of them might be chosen by
one of the sisters in the cave before the others.

Not only did they spy on each other's whereabouts, but they also felt
compelled to comment on them afterward. If they heard that a brother
had achieved something recently, they would make sarcastic remarks and
express jealousy. Conversely, if a brother had made a mistake, they would
mock and ridicule him, taking pleasure in his misfortune.

Confused by such behavior, the lesser yaoguais in the cave approached
Commander Beetle to seek an explanation.

Commander Beetle explained, "Their fear isn't about failing to marry a
lady; it's that their brother's promotion will cut into their own benefits."
Hearing this, the lesser yaoguais were even more perplexed.

Commander Beetle continued, "The Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master will
not permit the Scorpion family to amass excessive power. Thus, if one of
the four brothers ascends to the position of prince consort, the prospects
for the others inevitably wane. This principle extends to the official roles

within the cave. Take Scorpion Eldest, for instance; having gained the
favor of the Second Madam, he faces the most exclusion from his
brothers."

"But the eldest one is indeed more capable, while the others are not as
competent," one lesser yaoguai chimed in.

"Exactly. Because he has some skills, his brothers only talk behind his back
and don't dare to confront him directly. Were it someone less skilled, it
might not be the same...".
