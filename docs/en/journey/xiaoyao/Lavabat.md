Flaming Mountains harbored numerous caves, yet most were filled with
flowing lava, unfit for dwelling or practice. Finding a cool cavern was a
prized rarity. However, as adept flyers in the mountains, the lesser bat
guais often discovered comfortable caves on sheer cliffs. Unfortunately,
the larger guais followed suit and claimed these caves for themselves.
Angered by constant displacements, the bats were resolute in moving to
Furnace Valley, a place of towering firefalls and rivers of molten rock. No
other guais would dare to venture there, and all advised them to leave.
The bats, undeterred, dismissed the warnings and retorted, "We can
never secure a comfortable hideout when you are around. That's why
we've chosen the most dangerous and treacherous place. In our spiritual
practice here, it's a matter of life or death; we're done being victims and
pushed around!"

Fortune favored their resolve and rewarded their practice. Though the
scorching lava burnt them time and again, it forged their fiery skins, and
dodging the spewing magma honed their agility.

Alas, no path is set in life. While well-trodden roads may offer smoother
travel, striking out anew invites trials and derision. Yet, the fruits of such a
journey are uniquely gratifying.
