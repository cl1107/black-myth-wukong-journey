In the highland bounds, a famed wine estate thrived, renowned for its
medicinal brews. These beverages, with their enchanting aroma and
exquisite flavor, were beloved by the people, and its business flourished.
The master of the estate had two sons, coming of age, noble in their
aspirations yet prideful in their hearts. Cared not for the art of brewing,
they spent their time seeking the company of heroes, heedless of their
father's admonishments.

It was at this time that a bereaved family in the village uncovered a
disturbing incident-the desecration of their loved one's grave. The
villagers gathered there, only to discover the shattered coffin lid and
clusters of fungi where the corpse should have lain. Such sporadic
incidents had occurred before, yet remained unresolved, prompting the
brothers to uncover the truth.

Day after day, they scoured the mountains. Until one fateful night, as the
two stealthily returned home in the darkest hour, they caught a glimpse of
a figure disappearing into their brewery cellar. They pursued the
presumed thief, only to discover a monstrous creature capped with a
blood-red lingzhi mushroom. Without hesitation, the brothers lunged
forward, slaying the creature on the spot.

The sounds startled the master, who arrived only to find the lingzhi
creature lying dead. Filled with a mix of anger and frustration, he revealed
that the creature was in fact the brewer of the finest beverage of the estate.
His sons, who had been intent on showcasing their conquest, were filled
with shame and regret, and dared not utter another word.

Their business dwindled in the years that followed; a once grand manor in
disarray. Unable to endure the situation any longer, the brothers resolved
to leave home in search of a new life. Prior to their departure, the aged
master hosted a grand feast, bidding farewell to them alongside relatives
and friends. Curiously, after their departure, the business suddenly
flourished once more. Only the master knew the reason behind it. Every
midnight, two monstrous beings, bearing an uncanny resemblance to his
sons, with lingzhi mushroom caps atop their heads, would toil to craft the
finest brews for the brewery.
