# Wushan Lesser Guai

> Gaping mouth, round belly, born incomplete,
> Bulky form, craving and chasing tasty treats.
> Greedy for flavors, it longs for delight,
> Wagging its tongue, it speaks in spite.

One spring, the Webbed Hollow hosted a grand banquet to mark the
blossoming of the flowers. A young guai from Mount Wushan, having
presented the gift, saw the ladies chatting and laughing at the feast and
decided to join the other guais in the cave for drinks and merriment.

A few cups in, the guais began to jest with each other. A pig guai remarked,
"1'd rather live in this rich cave of yours, with banquets for every season
and festival. Back in our place, the Lady is too strict to allow any fun."

A proud insect guai responded, "Our ladies in the cave often host
banquets to keep the mistress company. We may not compare to the halls
of the Celestial Court, but our second lady has some businesses in the
mortal world, so we're not short on silver. It's tough, though; if she didn't
find ways to bring in money, we wouldn't have made it this far."

Another pig guai added, "Beautiful and elegant are all your ladies. I
wonder which celestial mountain is fortunate enough to be where they
might start their new families."

The insect guai laughed, "Our ladies can't leave this place. The businesses
outside are managed by carefully chosen people. Since we only take
bridegrooms who marry into the family, the talented ones don't want to
come, and the ladies don't fancy those who do. Look over there, those
four scorpions; their family is in decline, and their descendants are
unworthy. Only one is somewhat acceptable, but not one of our ladies
would marry him. Whoever gets unlucky will marry him on a fateful day,
so they say."

The guais laughed heartily, enjoying themselves, when suddenly there
was a shout, "Oh no! The ladies are quarreling!"
A panting pig guai in charge ran over, shouting, "The mistress in the cave
has lost her mind. She got into a fight with our Lady over a few words from
a maid and even smashed the very gift that was brought."

The guais were all startled. The clever ones quickly wrapped some food in
lotus leaves and handed it to the pig guais as an apology,"Next time, we'll
make sure there's no misunderstanding. Sorry for spoiling the fun."
"All right, all right! The pig guais took the food and hurriedly followed
the steward out, asking, "What exactly happened?""
"Who knows? It's all too odd. Every time we come, there's a commotion.
I've heard their mistress is always quite muddle-headed..."
