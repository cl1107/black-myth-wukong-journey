# Bull Governor

> Toils endlessly in the mortal land.

In bygone days, a young boy hid in a neighbor's storeroom to play with
fire. Accidentally, he ignited the items inside. Fearing punishment, he
attempted to extinguish the flames himself, but they quickly grew out of
control. The entire storeroom was consumed, and tragically, the boy
perished in the blaze.

His death left behind a great calamity. The neighbors demanded
compensation for the lost items from his parents, while his parents
demanded compensation for their son's life. The arguments raged on, and
even on the seventh day after the boy's death, the day that his soul should
be fetched, no resolution was reached. With the ritual at the funeral
disrupted, and the Bull- Head and Horse-Face, the soul fetchers, refused
to escort his soul. Seeing his subordinates' reluctance, the Bull Governor
decided to escort the boy himself.

As they approached the boy's home, they heard the sounds of his parents
quarreling with the neighbors. Entering the courtyard, they saw the boy's
parents accusing, "Our son died in your storeroom. Who knows if he
stumbled upon some illicit activity and was silenced?" The neighbors
retorted, "Our storeroom held valuable items. Your son must have had
thieving intentions, causing the fire. You must compensate us."

Their heated dispute eventually became ended up violence. The Bull
Governor asked the boy, "Did you ever foresee this outcome?" The boy,
filled with regret, wept bitterly. The Bull Governor, in his compassion,
said, "Enough. Such chaos on a soul-fetching day is disrespectful." With
that, flames erupted from his shoulder, and he struck an old tree in the
courtyard with his halberd, setting it ablaze. The tree was charred black,
and only then did the quarreling crowd remember it was the soul-
fetching day. In a panic, they all fled the courtyard..
