Among the wolf guais, there was a young one, ambitious and always seeking
rapid progress on the path of Dao. However, his time spent practicing was
short, and his skills remained shallow. He couldn't yet grasp the deeper
techniques of his clan, leaving him impatient.

One day, during his routine patrol, he carried a cask of fine wine. As he
passed the mountain gate, he encountered the gatekeeper, Bullguard, who
had a weakness for liquor. Eager to learn, the young wolf shared the wine
with Bullguard and seized the opportunity to inquire about secret
techniques. Partaken in the wine, feeling compelled, Bullguard taught him a
few tricks. Rejoicing, the young wolf hurried home to practice.

Two months passed, and having found little benefit in those teachings, he
contemplated giving up. Recalling his previous success in bartering wine for
knowledge, he retrieved a small golden statue and approached the Snake
Patroller. Persuaded by gold, the greedy creature shared some techniques
with him. Back at home, the young wolf practiced as instructed. Another
month passed, yet his gains remained minimal. Undeterred, he repeated his
tactics with other guais, exchanging valuables for teachings.

Over time, he visited everyone in the mountain, amassing a repertoire of
techniques. Yet, despite practicing one today and another the next, he made
no progress. Eventually, a compassionate elder wolf offered guidance. Yet,
the young wolf conversely started lecturing the kind old wolf with his
strange mastery, leaving him speechless. From that point on, no one in the
clan was willing to teach him.
