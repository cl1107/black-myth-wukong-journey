# Supporter Monk

> Strength unused, with no place due,
> Lifting stones, a task askew.
> Eyes so bright, yet lost in haze,
> An empty gaze, lost in self's maze.

In the past, the craftsmen building the grand hall in the New West
frequently encountered strange occurrences, leading many to quit.
Curious, one craftsman sought out the abbot, reputed to be a high monk,
for answers.

The abbot, without hesitation, led him to the Great Pagoda, where he
revealed the Lantern Warden. The craftsmen were terrified, having heard
tales of yaoguais in their youth but never having seen one. At that
moment, a wondrous sound echoed through the Great Pagoda, and the
Lantern Warden emitted a blinding light, causing the craftsmen to lose
their sight. They cried out in despair.

The abbot smiled and said,"To see the truth, one must be willing to
sacrifice even sight. You might as well stay here in this temple and practice
the path to ultimate bliss with me. Perhaps you will have the chance to
transcend and reach the Buddha's realm."

Realizing they were now blind and unable to find work, the craftsmen
decided to abandon the secular life and join the temple. They asked the
abbot how they should practice, and he replied, "Whatever you are skilled
at, practice that."

The craftsmen, known for their great strength, decided to pursue
enlightenment through martial arts. Despite their blindness, they trained
under the temple's Overseeing Monks. They tied large stones to iron
chains and attached them to their wrists, lifting them daily. This also
conveniently prepared the stones needed for the temple's construction.
The abbot was pleased and appointed them as Supporter Monks, saving a
considerable amount in labor costs.
