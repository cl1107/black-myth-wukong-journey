The story continues with the soul that escaped the underworld, now
ascending to the upper realm, filled with excitement. He followed the
celestial captain through alleys and corridors, eventually arriving at the
armory. The captain said, "These are the Chu-Bai armors, unmatched in
the mortal world." He then selected a set and handed it to the soul. They
proceeded to the side hall, but instead of entering the main hall, they
went to a side chamber where a minor official handed them a contract,
instructing the soul to sign and seal it.

The minor official indifferently warned, "By signing this contract, you
agree to serve in the Celestial Court forever, with no chance of
reincarnation." The soul, glancing around at the grandeur of the palace
and the elegance of the celestial beings, signed and sealed the contract
immediately.

The celestial captain then led the soul to the Tushita Palace. Again, they
did not enter the main hall but turned through a corridor to a massive
tower at the back. Thick black smoke billowed from the top, and many
soldiers were waiting outside, holding armor, ready to enter.

As the soul stepped inside, he felt the scorching heat. Numerous furnaces
blazed with fierce flames, and a giant cauldron hung above, melting
copper and iron. A Daoist boy with a fan approached, smiling,,"Celestia
soldier, heed my plea. Your flesh is gone, your soul must be. Bound to
armor, fierce and bold. In battles fought, be brave, yet hold. For if you
falter, heed this call, your very soul shall perish, fall."

With that, the boy pushed the soul into a mold, arranging the armor
pieces. Still bewildered, the soul saw the giant cauldron tilt above him,
pouring boiling molten metal. His piercing screams echoed through the
tower.
