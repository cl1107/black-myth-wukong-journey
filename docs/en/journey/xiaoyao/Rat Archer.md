In the days when the Kingdom of Flowing Sands warred against the
Fuban, there was a company of warriors known as the Four-Feathered
Army. Skilled archers they were, one and all, armed with repeating
crossbows and great shafts fletched with four feathers, capable of piercing
even the strongest iron. Great was the joy of these soldiers when the
weapons were placed into their hands, for they believed that with their
hard-earned skills and such mighty tools of war, victory would be swiftly
theirs.

As darkness fell, the soldiers gathered to discuss the strategies they would
employ. A veteran said, "shoot its eyes to blind it, and the bug won't be
able to hit us." A young one said, "shoot its heart to stop its breath, and the
creature will perish." Abrave one said, "shoot its legs to cripple it, and let
it wait for death." Long they debated, each seeking to sway the others, but
none could be swayed. At last, they resolved to each follow their own
strategy and see which would prevail on the field.

The next day, the Four- Feathered Army lined up in neat rows. At the given
signal, a storm of arrows was released. Yet each archer aimed as they
judged best, and not a single shaft found its mark in the same place as
another.

The hide of the Fuban was so thick that the rain of arrows served only to
vex the creature. In the end, the valiant soldiers were scattered and put to
flight.
Alas, minds divided need not always agree, yet the strength of one alone
has its limits. In unity lies true strength, and only with a single purpose can
the greatest deeds be accomplished. A fellowship divided against itself
cannot endure, but is ever doomed to ruin.
