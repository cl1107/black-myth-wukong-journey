The priests of Windrest were proud warriors. Their shields were
emblazoned with the tiger, and they danced with crescent-shaped spears,
commanding a presence that frightened off guais. During funerals, they
would lead the procession, striking their shields and proclaiming
themselves as leading generals.

The priests held a high status in Windrest. Even the minor guais in the
mountain would frequently offer them rare delicacies, hoping to ensure
their peace and to avoid being banished.

One day, a settler noticed an increase in the mountain's guai population
and sought the advice of the sorcerers. Dismissive, the priests responded,
"The guais and us, we inhabit the same mountains; an encounter would be
inevitable. Since they present us with tributes, we might as well spare
them."

A few years later, strange winds began to sweep across the valley, stirring
up chaos. The guais ran wild, causing trouble frequently. Dressed in their
warrior attire, the priests raised their shields and ventured out of the
settlement to confront the unruly guais.

However, the guais didn't fear them. The priests' spears and shields, which
were once their pride, could only repel a few minor ones before they were
surrounded. The leader, a red-robed rat, sneered, "We had peace only
because of the Bodhisattva meditating up in these mountains. You mortals
surely didn't think you could actually defeat us, did you?""
Seeing the priests unable to repel the guais and instead provoking their
anger, the settlers locked the gate of Windiest, demanding that the guais
be expelled before they could return.

The priests met their end on the mountains, remaining in their battle
stances, serving as ominous omens to those who pass by.
