The grand hall was filled with pious devotees attending the ceremony.
This was the fourth ceremony organized by Yellowbrow for his mortal
believers.

A devotee had attended three times, witnessing numerous miracles on
each occasion. However, it was the first time for his acquaintance from
their hometown to attend such a ceremony, and the acquaintance
harbored deep suspicions.

Before long, two blind monks carried in a statue of a Wrathful Vajra. The
devotee introduced it to his acquaintance, saying, "This Vajra can discern
a person's goodness or evil."

As he finished speaking, two men approached the statue, accusing each
other over some grievances. In no time, they were reduced to ashes by the
Vajra.

The acquaintance was shocked by the abruptness of it all. Just then, he
heard heavy footsteps outside the hall. Looking out through the window,
he saw a giant with blue skin, draped in a golden spiked robe, walking
slowly towards them.

The devotee introduced again, "This guardian can judge a person's
sincerity." After saying this, the monks led the crowd to present their
offerings to the guardian one by one. He reminded, "Make sure to give
away all your money.'

The acquaintance, deeply distrustful of the devotee's words, said, "You've
been deceived by them. These monks are all frauds."
The devotee retorted angrily, "How can you speak so recklessly? Why
Would I deceive you, being from the same hometown?"
"Who knows if you're in cahoots with them?""
Their argument grew louder and louder. The Vajra, seeing their quarrel,
raised its steel fork and charged at them.

The acquaintance quickly fled, but the devotee shouted, "Don't be afraid,
I will prove my sincerity!" The Vajra showed no hesitance.
Just when the acquaintance thought his fellow townsman was doomed,
the blue-skinned giant raised his hand to block the Vajra, saving the
devotee's life.

From then on, the acquiantance became a regular at the ceremonies,
always making sure to give away all his money before leaving, just like his
fellow townsman.
