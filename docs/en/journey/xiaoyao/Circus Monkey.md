# Circus Monkey

> Through hoops they leap, and somersault,
> With drums and tricks, their skills exalt.
> The wicked stride with fearless ease,
> The kind are burdened, souls aggrieved.

Years ago, after Mount Huaguo was destroyed, the Macaque Chief led his
followers away, seeking a new place to practice. They trekked to the
Flaming Mountains, hoping to settle there. However, a plague soon broke
out among the monkeys. The Macaque Chief ordered the sick monkeys to
be thrown into a deep valley. This action instilled fear among the
monkeys, causing them to abandon him and wander aimlessly.

They traveled through mortal cities, disguising themselves as circus
monkeys to earn a living. However, after each performance, the audience
would disperse, leaving them with meager earnings and empty bellies.
One day, a monkey had a sudden idea: why not use their performances to
gather people together and then rob them? With that thought, they beat
their drums and gongs, performing energetically to attract a crowd. Once
the audience had gathered, they killed them, stripped them of their
clothes and valuables, and fled to the next city.

It was in this manner that they eventually reached the New West, and
upon hearing that the Macaque Chief was also practicing there, they
decided to become monks. Feeling the weight of his guilt toward his kin,
the Macaque Chief avoided them, which only fueled their resentment.
Knowing they were no match for the Macaque Chief, they took on the role
of welcoming guests, so that by striking a gong, they could summon other
guais patrolling the area. They waited every day for the chance to see the
Macaque Chief, planning to summon the local guais and give him a good
beating when the time came!
