# Golden Lotus Guai

> Auspicious clouds above, unaware of worldly strife,
> Descendants scattered far, seeking out a better life.

Ancient texts state that whenever Bodhisattvas or Buddhas manifested
their divine presence, golden lotuses bloomed from the earth, radiating
brilliance.

As time passed, these golden lotuses grew increasingly discontent. They
saw the rat of Mount Lingshan, who became a king by stealing lamp oil;
the carp of the Southern Sea, who became a great lord by stealing
Guanyin's lotus flowers; and even the scorpion that stung the Buddha,
gaining the power and became a powerful yaoguai. In contrast, despite
their diligent service, the golden lotuses received nothing.

After careful consideration, they decided to entrust the burden of
greatness to their descendants. They scattered their seeds across the
mortal realm, hoping they would become yaoguais of power and
eventually earn a title in the upper realm.

However, the golden lotuses did not anticipate the path to greatness to be
that arduous in the mortal world. With many intelligent and brave mortal
beings also seeking enlightenment, the competition was fierce and brutal.
The golden lotuses then tried various methods: transforming into women
to deceive men and steal their vital essence, only to be recognized and
slain by Daoists; transforming into old men to use their wits to deceive and
devour scholars, only to be seen through and mocked. Such attempts
were numerous and often futile.

Trials and tribulations made the golden lotuses gradually realized that
their original form, the auspicious flowers indicating the Buddhas's
presence, had a better chance of success. Hence, they went to the temples,
using the auspiciousness to lure people into picking them, only to devour
them afterward.

Alas, if one seeks to perceive the world solely in pursuit of quick success,
how complex the world becomes! Cause and effect are intertwined, and
fate is mysterious. Every step taken is predestined.
