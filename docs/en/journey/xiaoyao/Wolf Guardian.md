# Wolf Guardian

> The wolf's heart was once kind and sound,
> Misled, however, consumed by desire.
> The path to return was once easily found,
> Yet fate was sealed by the words of a liar.

There was a year when a young wolf followed a grey elder wolf to learn
the art of hunting. The master taught him that a great hunter strikes
swiftly and surely, sparing their prey from suffering. The young wolf
pondered this long and hard. After years of training, he devised his own
killing technique. He thought his master would be pleased with his
progress, but instead, the elder wolf scolded him for disrupting the circle
of karma and told him to repent. The young wolf's mind swam with
confusion at his master's seeming contradiction.

And so, the young wolf left Black Wind Mountain and wandered the
lands. On his travels, he heard folks whisper that wolves, though hardy
and loyal to each other, were brutal, vicious, and treacherous. The wolf
guai grew more perplexed. It seemed his years of training went against the
ways of the world.

One day, as he passed through the New West, he heard tales of a dharma
of ecstasy in that place that could free a troubled mind. He sought an
audience with the abbot.

The abbot was a chubby monk in yellow robes who loved to change form.
He heard out the wolf guai's woes and counselled, ""Wolves are born to
hunt, to slay. It is the way of your kind. Men are not the same; they are
born to plough and plant, to reap and sow. Frail and feeble, such is their
lot. They seek to leash you wolves with false pre-empts, for they hope to
escape your fangs and claws. But heed me, wolf: each kind must follow the
call of their blood, the song of their soul. Why should you bow to the
mewling of men?."

These words lit up the wolf guai's mind. At that moment, he knew his path
lay within the halls of New Thunderclap Temple, where he would walk
the road to ecstasy. The chubby monk laughed, "In my temple, we bow to
none save our own hearts. Beware, for those who fear death have no place
here." The wolf guai gladly accepted and became the monk's most loyal
guardian. Armed with a scythe, he is now bound by no code save his own
savage joy. Heed not a word from his tongue.
