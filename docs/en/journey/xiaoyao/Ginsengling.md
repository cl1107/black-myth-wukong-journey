# Ginsengling

> Inherent gifts in these mystical sprouts reside,
> Walking forth from the earth, spirits untied.
> Roots serve as limbs, nourishing body and mind,
> Beware, excessive gathering brings hardships unkind.

It was written in ancient records that consuming ginseng could bestow
longevity, leading many to develop a fervent passion for devouring this
precious tuber-especially aged ones. However, some scholars dismissed
this notion, viewing ginseng as both a tonic and a poison; its elevated
status stemmed from its humanoid appearance, they said. Nonetheless,
those who made their living by harvesting ginseng always found eager
buyers.

Deep within the valley, the younglings of ginseng shoots trembled with
fear at the unmistakable sound of footsteps. It was the dreaded rhythm of
the ginseng harvesters' mountain shoes, crushing the thick layers of
decaying leaves and rocky earth. And with every eerie resonance, the
siblings of the ginseng plants vanished, disappearing one by one. Only the
tiniest survivors managed to evade this grim fate, their diminutive size
providing a fleeting reprieve. Yet, even they bore the mark of fate-a
crimson thread, marking them, and restraining them. Who knew when
the harvesters would return, to dig them up once they grew into their full
potential?

Time raced by, swift and unyielding. And on that day, the familiar
footsteps resurfaced. With the years that had passed, it was likely the
offspring of harvesters who were generations younger than those who
came before; then a quickened pace, a sense of anticipation-the crimson
threads had surely been spotted. But oh, what ill fortune! As the ginseng
harvester reached for the thread, it led him to a grim sight-the entwined
remains of a skeleton. A curse gathered on the tip of his tongue, but before
he could spit it out, the ground behind him rumbled with the sound of
scattered dirt. He turned his head; the shifting soil unleashed a monstrous
creature, towering and menacing. Fear gripped the harvester, urging him
to flee, his frantic screams piercing the air, shouting of man-devouring
guais.
