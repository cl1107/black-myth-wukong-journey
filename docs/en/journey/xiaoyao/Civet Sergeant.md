Once, there was a rich landlord who had built many houses. Among them,
there was a court where none lived. It had a clear pond, an old elm, and a
swing. The village children longed to play there.

The landlord, however, ordered his servants to guard the court and allow
no one near. As days passed, the children grew bolder. They began
throwing pebbles to draw the guards away, hoping to sneak in.
The day soon came when one of the servants was struck in the eye by a
pebble they threw. Enraged, the landlord decided to dismiss the
guardians of the court and simply locked the gate, posting a notice that
read: "Beware the civet guai within. Enter at your own risk!""

The young ones dismissed the warning as nothing but an empty threat.
They scaled the walls, gathered the elm seeds, played on the swing, and
caught fish in the clear waters of the pond. Their laughter echoed through
the court.

All of a sudden, tiles from the roof came hurtling down, landing near the
children. Startled, they cried out loud and drew their parents to the court.
The adults arrived, shouting for the owner of the place and demanding
recompense for the peril that had befallen their children.

After much shouting, a sharp voice rang out from the rear roof: "Be gone,
mortals, lest you seek your doom!" At those words, two blades whirled out
from nowhere, spinning in a deadly dance, and left wounds upon many. In
terror, the crowd turned and fled.
