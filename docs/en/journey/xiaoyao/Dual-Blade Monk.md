# Dual-Blade Monk

> Clad in red attire, with twin blades in hand,
> His pristine edges dance and gleam, their spirit bold and grand.
> Within each blade resides, a hidden art concealed,
> Midlife brings true wisdom, the balanced path revealed.

In days past, a monk wielding twin blades sought out New Thunderclap
Temple, hoping to learn more advanced techniques there.
His blades were plain in appearance, thus, upon entering the New West
and seeing the dazzling and peculiar weapons of the yakshas, he was filled
with envy. In his childhood, he had once admired a pair of ornate blades,
but his master had scolded him for his vanity: "Focusing on the beauty of
your weapon will only lead you astray in martial arts."
The monk had taken these words to heart, but now, seeing that others did
not adhere to this principle, he began to waver.

He approached the yakshas, inquiring about the aesthetics of their swords.
The yakshas were puzzled and replied, "The more beautiful the blades, the
more I want to practice with them. How could that be a hindrance?"
Still uncertain, the monk sought advice from his senior, Non- Pure, who
Was skilled with a monk's spade. Non- Pure replied, "Since you have
already mastered your techniques, why cling to the past?""

Taking this to heart, the monk abandoned his old blades and, inspired by
the yakshas' ornate designs, forged himself a pair of new, elaborate blades,
hoping to fulfill his childhood dream. However, despite their striking
appearance, the new ones were not the familiar, plain ones he had used for
years, and with these new weapons, new flaws were revealed in the
techniques he had honed over so many years.

Alas, spring gives birth, summer nurtures, autumn harvests, and winter
stores. All things have their seasons. Gaining something out of season,
even if obtained, is still a loss. Understanding the right moment for all
things is indeed a difficult lesson to learn!
