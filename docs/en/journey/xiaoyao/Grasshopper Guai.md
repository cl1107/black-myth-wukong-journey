# Grasshopper Guai

> Slender legs, a verdant sheen,
> Each arm wields a sickle keen.
> Misty woods are his home so true,
> He cares for youth, like me and you.

During the reign of the greatest emperor of Han, there was a village called
Bath. From within its mountains, a hot spring flowed, reputed to preserve
youth and vitality. Nobles flocked to it from far and wide.
One day, the Marquis of Lecheng came to visit with his six-year-old son.
The young lord caught a little grasshopper and wanted to keep it as a pet,
so he tore off its wings and trapped it in a teacup.

That night, the Marquis was visited in his dreams by a man clad in green.
"Your child has imprisoned mine," he pleaded. "We are both fathers. I
beseech you, help my little one."

The next morning, the Marquis summoned his son and inquired about
what happened. The boy, who feared his stern father, only provided vague
replies. Thus, the full story remained elusive to both. That night, the
green-clad man revisited the Marquis' dreams, with twin swords at his
waist. He warned, "If you don't return my son, you'll never see yours
again." The Marquis woke with a start and rushed to his son's bed, only to
find it empty. Servants scoured the village but found no trace.
Only the young lord's page remembered the bug-catching. He rushed to
the study, found the overturned teacup, and gently released the
grasshopper onto the grass.

By noon, the young lord returned home safely, yet his hands were red and
swollen, and he couldn't stop weeping. When questioned about the
events of the previous night, he sobbed, "1 dreamt ofa man in green, a
great jumper. He carried me on his back and hopped a few times. Then, I
didn't know where I was. He scolded me for harming others and struck
my palms with his swords twenty times." When asked how he came back,
he was unable to answer, overwhelmed by fear.

Alas, it is said that all beings love their young, a truth that spans the world.
Even yaoguais, it seems, are no different.

In the late years of the Han, the hot spring in Bath suddenly dried up.
Insect guais sprouted in the hills, so the villagers moved down the
mountain. A decade or two later, the area came to be known as the
Webbed Ridge.
