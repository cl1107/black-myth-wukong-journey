# Yaksha Patroller

> In the mountains high above, a fiend blocks the way,
> With a hideous visage, and a crooked blade in sway.
> As the wind howls wildly, souls seem to fade,
> For life's last salvation, be swift and do evade.

The yakshas who migrated from the west had a great fondness for meat.
Fortunately, New Thunderclap Temple did not uphold a strict rule against
eating meat, which delighted the yakshas who sought refuge there.
All the yakshas in the mountains aspired to become Patrollers, not only
because of the uniquely designed large sword that looked particularly
imposing and could fly back to its owner with great precision, but also
because Patrollers guarded the outer mountains and always had access to
fresh meat.

One day, the yakshas gathered together, drinking blood, eating meat, and
reveling in their merriment. Their raucous behavior soon became known
throughout the temple. The Overseeing Monks, who adhered to ascetic
practices and only ate food not of flesh, were displeased. They carried a
large pot to the yakshas. When the yakshas peered into the pot, they saw
only radishes and greens, and their appetite waned.

One yaksha derided them, "Do you think eating this will help you gain a
deeper understanding of Dharma? How shallow." Another added, "Our
master said that to achieve ultimate bliss, one should not restrain one's
desires." Hearing this, the supervising monk replied, "My desire is to
promote virtue. If I cannot persuade you, I too shall be unable to achieve
ultimate bliss." Thus, both sides argued heatedly, without reaching a
conclusion.

Alas, eating what one likes and saying what one wants are not inherently
wrong. However, one's happiness should not disturb others, and one
should never derive pleasure from judging those perceived to have
transgressed. In this case, both sides were at fault.
