Long ago, a mountain village sat on a ridge teeming with insects. Strange
things kept happening, so the villagers all moved out, leaving it a deserted
village. In the village below lived a young man. His mother had died, and
his father was a poor wastrel who paid him no mind. The villagers looked
down on him and often abused him. He felt he couldn't endure such
disdain, so he fled to live in the abandoned village. Little did he know that
the village was claimed by a swarm of insect guais.

As soon as the young man reached the ridge, the yaoguais seized him. He
didn't fight back, as a deep-rooted death wish, stemming from a life
without attachments, had long infested his heart. Seeing his resignation,
the insects didn't harm him. Instead, they provided him shelter in a
dilapidated shack.

That night, a middle-aged Daoist brought him food and clothing. "1 heard
you have nowhere to go, so I brought you some things for daily use. If you
don't mind, take me as your master and stay here. I can teach you practices
for ascension." The youth hadn't been cared for in so long. He eagerly
donned the Daoist robe and performed the rites to acknowledge his
master. From then on, he lived and trained with the insect guais. They
spent their days dining and walking together, and at night, they slept side
by side.

One day, a scholar barged into the young man's room. "I've just escaped
from the yaoguais' lair. They had trapped me in a cocoon sack, and I'm
unsure of their intentions. I'm fleeing this place. You're human, you
should come with me." The young man shook his head. "I'm content here.
Why should I leave?" The scholar grew angry, "Because they're yaoguais
and you're human! Even if they don't harm you, staying with them long
enough will turn you into a yaoguai as wel!"

"You're right," the young man said as he grabbed his staff and knocked the
scholar to the ground. "But even if I turn into a yaoguai, I'll do so gladly."
The scholar deemed that the young man was past saving. Gritting his teeth
against the pain, he crawled out the door and fled alone.
