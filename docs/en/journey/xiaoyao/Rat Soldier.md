# Rat Soldier

> Helmets bright and halberds keen,
> Marching where the war-banners lean.
> To the border's drum, they march in time,
> Behind their shields, their courage climbs.

In Sandgate Village, a rat widow grieved; her husband, devoured by the
Tiger Vanguard, had left nothing behind but his Sand Shield, a royal
reward. Her sons, born after their father's demise, were her last hope.
Pointing to the shield, she decreed to her growing sons, "If you don't slay
that tiger, you're no sons of mine." And so they trained with the Second
Prince, vowing to take vengeance on the Tiger Vanguard.

Among them, one boy, frail and ill-suited for combat, loved ink and paper
over spear and shield. His mother's scolding and punishments were
frequent, forcing him to commit to the martial arts. He did try hard, yet
his efforts only left him feeble and trembling. The same skill that took only
a few days to acquire for his peers could take him weeks with no
noticeable progress. Even the Prince urged him to explore a different path,
therefore the boy's enthusiasm for martial waned further.

As his brothers donned red armor and golden shields, he stood alone,
enduring more beatings and scorn. Once, his mother went too far with her
harsh words, "Better to be eaten by the tiger than remain useless at home,"
which drove him to steal his father's shield and spear to fulfill his mother's
wish. The Tiger Vanguard knocked him down in two moves, mouth
opened for a gulp.

But stones were hurled, striking the tiger in his head. Startled, the Tiger
Vanguard gazed around for the culprit. Some of the rats seized the
moment, dragging away their kin from the tiger's grip. The Vanguard
turned to chase, but there stood the rat soldiers, those who had never
ventured from the dunes, now spears pointed, shields hoisted-a line of
defiance so fierce, they dared the tiger to challenge them. The tiger
hesitated, and the rats left safely.

That boy did later forsake the warrior's way, but he took up his bow
alongside the rat archers. With a sharp mind and truer aim, he even saved
his kin in turn.
