# Overseeing Monk

> With closed eyes, he practices through mere fist,
> In silence, discerns the loyal from the twist.
> Cutting thoughts, he seeks the pure domain,
> Desires quelled, new bonds are slain.

In the temple, all monks could seek guidance from those more skilled.
Among them, the monks who were passionate about fist martial arts
always followed the second senior disciple, Non-Able, to practice and
train. Their temperament was also similar to Non-Able's, as they were
most inclined to fight for justice, earning them the title of "Overseeing
Monks."

Since the Non-Able was punished by the master and sent to the Towers of
Karma to reflect on his mistakes, the Overseeing Monks lost their
protector. As a result, they often suffered greatly when standing up for
others.

Troubled, the Overseeing Monks went to ask the master the solution. The
master smiled and said, "If you do not see, your mind will be free from
obstacles. The greatest affliction of men is weakness. Close your eyes and
focus on your own cultivation.."

Initially, the Overseeing Monks covered their eyes with cloth, but when
they removed the cloth, they still couldn't ignore what they saw and
heard. Then, Yellowbrow suggested, "Why not try gouging out your
eyes?.

From then on, the temple had a new skill named "Blind Zen". Practitioners
of this art nurtured their minds to be as serene as still waters, by turning a
blind eye to the distractions of the world.
But can they truly attain stillness? Perhaps any slight sound would only
further agitate their restless hearts.
