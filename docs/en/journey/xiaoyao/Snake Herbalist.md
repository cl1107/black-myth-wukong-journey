In the old days, there was a Daoist temple at the foot of Purple Cloud
Mountain. An ascetic Daoist nun, worn from her long travels, sought
shelter there one night. The temple nuns, moved by her devotion, offered
her hot water and fresh clothes.

As she bathed, the nun heard a sound from the rafters. Without showing
any sign of alarm, she put on her robe and nonchalantly picked up her fly.
whisk. With a gentle flick, the whisk stretched and coiled with her
motion, snaking up to the rafters and seizing a yaoguai.

Alerted by the commotion, the temple nuns rushed into the room to
investigate. On the ground crouched a snake guai with green scales,
unfazed by its capture. It seemed the nuns had been its prior victims, now
taking turns to scold it. The snake guai looked at them with contempt and
puffed out its cheeks to spew green venom in every direction. Anyone
struck by even a drop collapsed at once, writhing in pain.

As the guai had no remorse, the nun took out a wispy golden needle,
prepared to destroy it. Only then did the snake show fear. It pleaded at
once: "I'm just a lesser herbalist guai from the mountain. In my basket
outside is the antidote for them. Please, will you spare my life, immortal
lady?"

Hearing its sincere plea, the nun granted it mercy. The guai rummaged in
its basket and handed her some small white pellets. "These are the leaves
of the pearl tree. They're rare in the mortal world and can cure all
venoms." It fed one to each Daoist nun, and they recovered at once.

After that, the temple always had tree pearls on hand, and many afflicted
by venom came here to seek aid. But the high cost of a tree pearl meant
many, unable to afford it, had to face the toxin's fatal outcome.
