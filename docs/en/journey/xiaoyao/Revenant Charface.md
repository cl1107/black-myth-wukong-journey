# Revenant Charface

> Time gallops like a horse so fair,
> Here and there, seeming without care.
> Past flows like water in its course,
> Dreams buried deep, without remorse.

The gates of the City of Injustice are guarded by the charfaces. Unlike soul
reapers, they wield blades of karmic flames, burning lost souls to ash-
hence their perpetually smoked visages.

One day, two charfaces at the gate caught a soul trying to sneak out. As
one raised his flaming blade to strike, the desperate soul pleaded, "Spare
me, kind sirs. Should I revive, I'll burn ten houses of paper ingots in your
honor." The other charface restrained his companion and proposed, "Let's
have a wager then. If you win, you go free. But if you lose, blame your own
luck." The soul asked, "What would be the wager?" And he answered: "If
half the souls entering the city today wish to return to life like you, you
win." With that, he handed over paper and ink and tasked the soul with
recording the names and earthly obsessions of those newly deceased.

As the gate closed for the day, the soul hurried to the charfaces and
declared, "I've won! I've won indeed!" The charfaces presented the list to
the Gatemaster, who found that it matched perfectly in both numbers and
names and even included details the deceased themselves hadn't
revealed. Satisfied, the Gatemaster held the soul in high regard,
generously rewarded him, and said, "1 know you seek to leave the city, but
the gates are shut for today. Perhaps you should come again tomorrow."

Months passed with the soul returning daily, and each day a similar bet
was made. Over time, the soul ceased longing for a return to life and took
up a role as a scribe under the Gatemaster.

Alas, it makes one wonder: should we look ahead and accept whatever
future awaits us, or stay committed to steadfast goals? Perhaps there's no
right answer. What matters is the willingness to make your choice.
