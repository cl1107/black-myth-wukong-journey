The insect guais loathed patrolling after dusk, as their instinct to chase
after light made the nighttime perilous for them. But luck favored them
when a tribe of pale-faced yakshas from the west of the place, having
traversed the world, chose to settle at the Webbed Ridge and volunteered
for the night watch, a task the insect guais were only too happy to
relinquish to these newcomers.

The yakshas are proud and fierce by nature. Turned into feral yaoguais, yet
they still clung to their old ways in the days they were revered. They kept
to their own, with lanterns lit from dusk to dawn, and rarely mingled with
the insect guais. To the latter, they were a curious sight with their
merriment and banter that paid no heed to hierarchy or status. Yet, what
puzzled the insect guais most was the yakshas' bond; close-knit in joy, yet
they'd often erupt into disputes and hurl sharp words with no restraint.

One night, a quarrel broke out during an idle chatter among four yakshas
on patrol, and their raucous noise woke the insect guais. "Why must you
carry on as this?" the insect guais rushed to mediate, persuading them.
"Arguing one moment, chummy the next. Why not treat each other with
proper respect, like we do?""

In an instant, the quarrel ceased, and in unison, the yakshas retorted, "You
are mistaken," one spat. "Only through open discourse, we grow."
Another chimed in, "Exactly, when we air out our disagreements, it only
makes our bond stronger." A third added, "Indeed. By having each other's
backs, we've made it through a lot of tough times. Our harsh words don't
mean any harm." The last concluded, "Unlike you insect guais, we hide no
secret grievances under the guise of harmony." With that, arm in arm,
they departed, leaving the insect guais to dismiss the exchange with
bemused eye rolls.
