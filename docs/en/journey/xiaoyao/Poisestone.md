Before obtaining the Stone Essence, the Mother of Stones was originally a
blue quartz in the shape of a woman.

The blue quartz had the unique ability to absorb the essence of the moon.
Through ages of absorption, she attained enlightenment earlier than other
stone guais and was honored as the mountain deity.

When the Buddha-head stone guai appeared, the other stone guais
convened and decided to expel the guai from the mountain. They sought
the help of the Mother of Stones. However, she refused, fearing the
possibility of her blue quartz to be shattered in battle.

Yet on the day of battle, seeing that the stone guais were on the verge of
defeat, she could no longer bear to stand by and decided to join the fight.
Noticing the Palestones launching their quartz like a barrage of arrows to
sneak attack the Buddha-head guai, she imitated their action despite her
deep attachment to her precious quartz.

Despite their best efforts, they were still losing. When her blue quartz was
shattered by a punch, the Mother of Stones fell to the ground in despair.
Unexpectedly, a yellow-furred leading a group of yaoguais came to their
aid. Seeing her grievance, the rat persuaded, "What is broken is destined
not to return. If we let the guai escape, wouldn't it be an even greater
loss?""

Hearing this, the Mother of Stones regained her strength and rose up.
Together, they subdued the Buddha-head stone guai. As compensation for
her loss, the yellow-furred rat gifted her the Stone Essence.

With the essence bestowed, the Mother of Stones gained great powers.
Yet as her form grew less mobile, she crafted Poisestones from blue quartz,
reflections of her former self, to watch over the mountain's happenings.
Perhaps she did this to glimpse what she once was, what could never
return
