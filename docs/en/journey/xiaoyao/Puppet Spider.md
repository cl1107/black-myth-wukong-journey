Long ago, a woodcutter lived deep in the hills. One day, he went down to
the market fair and saw a puppet show. He loved it and yearned to see it
again.

One day, as he cut wood, he heard shouts of glee in the mountains. He
followed the sounds and saw a mob of yaoguais reveling together. Despite
his fear, curiosity urged him to climb a rock to watch them from afar. The
guais were gathered in a circle, watching an acrobat show. Too far to see
well, the woodcutter could only discern a red-clad guai whirling twin
blades in dazzling spins and flips.

Entranced, the woodcutter crept closer. He saw the acrobatic guai had
legs tied behind its back, strings dangling from its feet. In a flash, he knew
it was a puppetry trick. He climbed a large tree for a clearer view.

The guai had an ugly, comical face. To the woodcutter, this spectacle was
even more amusing than the finest plays at the market fair. He watched,
spellbound. A chill on his neck jolted him out of the reverie. Reaching up
to check, he found his fingers coated in green spittle. Looking up in
horror, he was greeted by a myriad of eyes staring down at him. There, in
the treetop, dangled a violet spider, its legs threaded with silk, tugging the
distant puppet guai to and fro.

The woodcutter yelped and fell from the tree. At that, the spider paused,
and the gathering of yaoguais turned as one to glare at him. Stricken with
terror, the woodcutter fled and, upon returning home, fell gravely ill. No
remedy could ease his suffering. He wasted away and soon died.
