# Red-Haired Yaksha

> With sword in hand, the foe's chest pierced,
> Blood-soaked hair, in battle fierce.
> Endless sorrow for a fallen land,
> East wind sighs, as west winds stand.

In the Kingdom of Yaksha, there were eight great generals, one of whom
was named Mi Yan. He had once practiced under the Golden Summit
Immortal at the Yuzhen Temple, located at the foot of Mount Lingshan.
Having fought countless battles, he possessed the valor of a warrior who
could face ten thousand enemies.

When a formidable enemy attacked, the Yaksha King appointed Mi Yan as
the vanguard general. Mi Yan set up a large camp at the border and
addressed his soldiers: "If any of you fear battle, walk away now, and I
won't hold it against you. But know that if we lose this foothold, the
kingdom will fall. Our elders, children, and all our wealth will become the
property of our enemies." With these words, he and the entire army swore
a blood oath to advance and never retreat.

The Yaksha army, isolated and outnumbered, faced an enemy surrounding
them on all sides, their banners blotting out the sky. Wave after wave of
enemy forces attacked relentlessly. Mi Yan and his troops fought fiercely,
suffering heavy casualties. Ultimately, Mi Yan was surrounded by
numerous Arhats and was beheaded.

The soldiers, countless among them having sacrificed their lives, retrieved
their general's head. Placing Mi Yan's head in his coffin, they witnessed his
body slowly sit up and lament. "If we lose our homeland. what difference
does it make whether I have a head or not?"

With these words, he closed his eyes and fell back down, finally passing
away as blood gushed from his neck, staining his hair red. Later, his
subordinates, in a display of loyalty and bravery, poured the blood of their
enemies over their heads, emulating Mi Yan. Despite their valor, the
Kingdom of Yaksha was ultimately destroyed, but not a single soldier from
Mi Yan's army deserted.
