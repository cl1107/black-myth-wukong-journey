# Scorching-Fire

> Ignorance ignites a fool's fire,
> Daily anguish in a somber mire.
> Enduring a life of ceaseless pain,
> They yearn for death, not celestial gain.

Legend has it that during the reign of the Yellow Emperor, an official of
pottery named Ningfengzi learned the art of fire with five-colored fumes
from immortals, and tried to ascend by roasting himself over the flames.
Some say he achieved ascension; others claim he burned himself to death;
no one knows the truth. The tale we have here is recounted by a runaway
disciple from the Fumefire Temple in the Kingdom of Sacrifice, a place
rooted in the art of the five-colored fumefire.

The master of the disciple served as the abbot of the temple. One day, the
disciple accompanied his master for some liquor in town, and they came
across a fugitive being pursued by officers. As the temple was short on
help, and the fugitive was a wealthy one, they offered him shelter. This
man, Zhao San, was a mere wastrel who lured patrons of brothels into
extravagant spending. The temple was already home to various robbers
and bandits, and it proved to be a corrupting influence on Zhao San. In the
company of fellow criminals every day, he soon became ten times more
villainous than before.

One day, Zhao San set off to rob travelers to fund his own lavish lifestyle.
He targeted a wealthy family returning from their monthly worship, and
in an act driven by greed and lust, he abducted the family's concubine,
Meiniang.

Imprisoned within the temple walls, Meiniang endured daily chores and
beatings. Despite her deep resentment towards Zhao San, she was
powerless against his violence. She could only grit her teeth and bide her
time, hoping for an escape.

Years later, a ceremony for ascension was announced in the temple. The
disciple who tells this story was tasked with escorting Meiniang to the
event, held atop a high cliff overlooking a river of lava. Zhao San had
already prepared to leap into the fire for ascension with a talisman from
his master. He insisted Meiniang accompany him. Amidst the frenzied
cheers of the followers and the terrified cries of Meiniang, the disciple
pushed the girl off the cliff as ordered.

Charred in the river of lava, their bodies swelled grotesquely as the lava,
guided by the talisman, seeped into their skulls. Their distorted new forms
staggered up, writhing in agony, and ran towards the depths of the black
mountains. Witnessing this horrifying transformation, the disciple
renounced his belief in the temple's teachings, no matter how vehemently
the master rationalized it as a transcendent metamorphosis.
