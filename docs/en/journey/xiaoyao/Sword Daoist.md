# Sword Daoist

> To seek the Dao, he journeys far,
> With steadfast heart, he finds the gate.
> In the depths of sword skills,
> He glimpses roots of ascension's innate.

Every ten years, the Temple of Yellow Flowers opens its doors to recruit
disciples.

One day, a newly admitted young Daoist discovered that the disciples
focused on innate practice were divided into three different groups based
on their skills. One group used staffs, another used fly-whisks, and the
third used swords.

The young Daoist observed them closely and noticed that the disciples
who used staffs and fly-whisks were also responsible for various chores
around the temple and had less favorable living conditions. In contrast,
the disciples who used swords only needed to focus on their training and
they were even privileged to receive daily guidance from the master. The
young Daoist secretly consulted the senior disciples and found out that
the sword disciples were also the quickest to achieve enlightenment and
ascension.

However, becoming a disciple of the sword group was no easy task. It
required passing a rigorous examination by the master, and only those
deemed to have the highest potential were given the opportunity. The
young Daoist visited each senior disciple, noting down the questions the
master had asked them in the past, and made thorough preparations.
Eventually, he succeeded in his endeavor, winning first place. The master
personally tied his hair into a topknot and bestowed upon him a sword.

From the moment he joined the sword group, he woke up early every day
to train under the supervision of the Commander Beetle. In the
afternoons, he strengthened his Qi under the master's guidance. Though
the life was monotonous and arduous, he was very content.

After more than a decade of rigorous cultivation, the disciples of sword
group finally earned the master's approval.

The master informed them that their skills were now proficient enough
for them to enter the mountains for secluded meditation. If they were
fortunate enough, they could achieve their ascension.
