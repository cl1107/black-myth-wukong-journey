In the land of Yellow Wind Ridge, where relentless winds raged day and
night, the tomb mounds were often ravaged by the mighty gusts, revealing
the exposed bones-a sight all too familiar.

One day, a hurried merchant found himself passing through Yellow Wind
Ridge on an urgent matter. However, the villagers warned him of the
terrible danger and refused to be his guide. After walking alone for hours,
the merchant rested by the roadside, eating his rations. It was then that he
noticed a set of skeletal remains in the withered grass. The bones were
incomplete due to greedy vultures and wolves. "Were you slain by
bandits, lying here in this desolate place? Or, like me, did you find no joy in
life and chose to end it yourself?" Overwhelmed with sorrow, the
merchant sighed as he looked upon the skull and wondered aloud. "You
now lie uncovered in the wilderness, and I can only imagine the sorrow
your family must feel." Moved by compassion, he untied his bundle,
Weeping as he began to dig a grave to bury the remains.
Suddenly, the skeleton sat up, startling the merchant, who fell to the
ground and scrambled backwards in fear. Using bony hands to support
itself, the skeleton approached the merchant and pushed the bundle
towards him. Astonished, the merchant cautiously accepted the bundle
and resumed his journey. The skeleton followed him from a distance, and
together they travelled peacefully for hours. Gradually, the merchant let
his guard down, and removed his inner shirt to drape it over the skeleton's
frame.

From that moment on, whenever a strange noise arose, the skeleton
would guide the merchant to take cover behind rocks. With furtive
glances, the merchant would then witness guais passing by the path. For
several days, they continued on this way until the merchant finally
reached the main road again. That was the moment the skeleton ceased to
move. Grateful for its companionship, the merchant offered to transport
the skeleton's remains back to its homeland. However, after a moment's
hesitation, the skeleton turned and walked back into the swirling sands of
the ridge. Perhaps, it had already forgotten where it came from.
