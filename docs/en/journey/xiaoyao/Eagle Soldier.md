Three men died on the same day, and their souls met in the underworld.
Kneeling before the judge, the judge pointed to one soul and said, "In life,
you were a thief, robbing and injuring others, bullying the innocent. Now,
I sentence you to the Mountain of Knives to atone for your sins." The man
wailed, "My kins burnt gold and silver paper ingots for me, and they could
fill ten storerooms. If you show mercy, all that wealth is yours." The judge
remained unmoved, flicked his sleeve, and had the underworld soldiers
take him away.

The judge then pointed to the second soul and said, "You shall be reborn
as a human." The soul protested,"1 diligently practiced Buddhism, did
many good deeds, and never harmed any living being. Why must I endure
the suffering of reincarnation?" The judge replied, "A human may see a
hundred springs, but the grass knows only one. Being reborn as a human is
already a privilege. Do you wish to be reborn as a beast?" The soul was
displeased and said, "Life as a human is arduous. I practiced Buddhism,
and it should grant me escape." The judge snorted coldly,"Today,
Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha is not here. Whether you escape or not is not up
to you." He flicked his sleeve, and the underworld soldiers took him away.

Finally, the judge pointed to the last soul and said, "In life, you stole mind
cores, and made pills which harmed lives. Now, I sentence you to the Pool
of Blood to cleanse your sins before you can reincarnate." Just as he was
about to have the underworld soldiers take him away, a celestial captain in
golden armor flashed into the hall, threw a military order on the table, and
said, "He has attained profound enlightenment. This is a summons from
the Celestial Court. The Admiral has sent me to escort him to become a
celestial soldier." Hearing this, the soul was overjoyed and quickly
followed the celestial general out.
