Once upon a time, there lived a pretentious scholar who took great pride
in a paperweight he collected. Whenever his guests commented that it
was merely an ordinary stone with no notable features, the scholar would
respond by sharing a peculiar tale.

During his adventurous youth, the scholar embarked on a treacherous
journey. Exhausted and seeking respite, he leaned against a massive stone
for a snooze. Suddenly, he felt the stone come alive. Skeletons emerged
from its crevices, and the stone sprouted limbs, resembling a grotesque
creature. Terrified, the scholar ran for his life until he stumbled upon a
desolate valley, where he noticed a gaunt monk meditating atop a
boulder. Struck by the peculiar sight, he contemplated fleeing once more.
Yet, to his astonishment, he sensed the relentless pursuit of the stone
creature from behind. Just as he stood on the verge of being crushed, the
very boulder beneath the monk unexpectedly rose, revealing two mighty
arms that pummelled and shattered the pursuing creature. Amidst this
terrifying clash, the scholar barely managed to escape. And the
paperweight, as he claimed, was a remnant of that cataclysmic fight.

The guests erupted into laughter upon hearing the tale, mocking the
scholar for spicing up his wild dream to impress them. The scorned
scholar, though indignant, began to doubt the truth of his tale himself and
lost interest in the paperweight. Eventually, he banished it to a forgotten
corner, never to be shown again.
