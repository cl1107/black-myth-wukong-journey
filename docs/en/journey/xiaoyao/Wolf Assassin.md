Once upon a time, a young wolf followed a grey elder wolf to learn the art
of hunting. Despite his cleverness and diligence, the young wolf struggled
to catch any prey. One day, the pale elder commanded him to find food
alone or face hunger. Then the young wolf, hiding in the shadows of the
mountains, finally managed to catch a rabbit. However, instead of eating it
alive, he gently licked the rabbit's wounds, as if to heal them.

The rabbit took the chance and fled into a pond, struggling to swim to
safety, but the young wolf in pursuit forced it back into the water. Just as
the rabbit was about to drown, the young wolf rescued it, softly nudging
its head and helping it breathe. The rabbit woke up conscious but
bewildered. Suddenly, the distant howl of the grey elder startled both of
them. In his panic, the young wolf accidentally crushed the rabbit under
his paw.

Heartbroken, the young wolf wept bitterly. As the elder approached and
inquired, it became clear: the young wolf couldn't bring himself to kill the
rabbit, so he repeatedly spared its life. Yet, he also feared his own hunger,
and that's why he refused to let go. Acknowledged, the grey elder then
advised, "Your false kindness brought misery. Instead of hesitation, both
of you would have been better off with a swift end."

The grey elder's words seemed to have dawned upon the young wolf.
Later, it honed a lethal technique of hurling whirling blades from afar for
stealth kills, believing this to be the ultimate form of mercy towards its
adversaries.
