# Earth Rakshasa

> Round eyes that gleam so bright,
> A body drenched in blood's light.
> With a seven-treasure hat adorned,
> A sincere heart, though face is scorned.

The Land Rakshasas are descendants of the Sea Rakshasas, born during
their exile. Due to the different Will of their new home, they did not grow
to the enormous size of their ancestors. Despite this, their loyalty to the
Rakshasa Lady remains as steadfast as that of their forebears. They strictly
adhere to the precepts set by the Rakshasi, diligently practicing their arts
and shedding many of their old vices.

There are many folk tales about Rakshasas being fond of eating human
flesh, which is why villages near Flaming Mountains often send their
elderly to the stone temple as offerings. In truth, the Rakshasas of Flaming
Mountains do not eat humans. On the contrary, because their immense
strength can easily harm mortals, the Rakshasi gives them specially crafted
heavy shields and instructs them to focus more on defend than attack.
However, if pushed to their limits, they will still unleash their fire-
breathing abilities.

Even though the Land Rakshasas have made many changes, people still
scream and flee in terror at the sight of their fearsome appearance. But
from the perspective of the Land Rakshasas, aren't those screaming
mortals just as terrifying?
