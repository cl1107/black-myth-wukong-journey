The disciples who practiced swordsmanship in the temple had been
training under their master for a long time. Since joining the group, they
had all harbored the wish to attain ascension, diligently practicing their
skills with great perseverance.

One day, the master finally informed his disciples that after years of
rigorous training, their skills had become proficient. He told them that
they could now follow him into the mountains for a secluded meditation.
If they were fortunate, they might achieve ascension and become
immortals. The disciples were overjoyed and eagerly packed their
belongings to follow their master into the mountains.

The master led them using a teleportation technique to a breathtakingly
beautiful mountain. The mountain was rustling golden leaves, presenting
a scene of crisp, refreshing autumn weather.

At the mountain's peak, there was a hamlet where they set down their
belongings. The master then led them along a path behind the hamlet to
the summit. There, they saw strands of silk hanging in the air, with one
end suspended in the mountain mist and the other reaching high into the
clouds, destination unknown. The master said, "This is the celestial ladder
to the Immortal Kingdom. Hundreds of years ago, your senior brother
ascended to immortality from this very spot."

With that, he handed each of them a peculiar object of a violet color and
said, "This is a pill to aid your ascension. Quickly, my disciples, consume
it."

The disciples, filled with excitement, immediately swallowed the larva-
like objects. A few hesitated, only to see a terrifying and disgusting scene:
the disciples taken the pills had transformed into flat-headed, fleshy
worms. Horrified, they questioned their master, shaking. The master
shook his head and sighed, "when the opportunity arises, your courage
fails, which make you unfit to become immortals."

Before his sigh had ended, the disciples who had transformed into worms
lunged at them...
