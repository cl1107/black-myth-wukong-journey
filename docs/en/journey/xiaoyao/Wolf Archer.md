# Wolf Archer

> A master archer, none can compare,
> Timid when danger fills the air.
> Never brave when faced with fear,
> Escape his choice, he stays clear.

The Black Wind King hosted a banquet in the temple to celebrate his
birthday, and all the yaoguais attended. During the feast, the King hung a
lucky ornament on a tree branch, declaring that anyone who could shoot
it would receive a rare fortifying golden pill as the reward. The yaoguais
Were eager to try, but the fierce wind hampered all their attempts.

Among the guests was an old wolf known for his remarkable archery skills.
He was cautious, unassuming, and kept to himself in a corner, nursing his
drink. A few eager yaoguais asked him to try, and though he declined, they
persisted with their teasing until he reluctantly agreed.

Slowly, the wizened old wolf stood up and moved to the position. Some
youngsters laughed at him, deeming him incapable. Unperturbed, he
calmly strung his bow, let loose an arrow, and struck the target dead
center, causing a commotion among the crowd.

The old wolf received the reward, and admiration followed suit as others
toasted him. Among them was a youngster, who commented on the bolus
intoxicated. "How generous our King is," he remarked, "Far better than
that Lingxuzi, who was good at making pills but never shared them with
his underlings. What a tightwad!" The youngster's words cast a shadow
across the old wolf's face, and he silently took his leave. "He had roamed
the mountain with Lingxuzi long before our King's reign. Yet, you judged
his deceased former master in front of him. Loyal as he is, you are in
trouble now!" warned an elder guai. However, the young guai shrugged
off his warning.

The next day, the old wolf returned the golden pill to the King, citing its
value too high to possess by an archer. Hearing the news, the other
yaoguais urged the young one to apologize and seek forgiveness, but he
remained defiant. Within a few days, while venturing outside, the
youngster was killed by several arrows, each piercing his heart. Many said
that even the golden pill couldn't save the youngster from his fate.
