Unlike the bee, wasp, hornet, katydid, cockroach, grasshopper, and
dragonfly-the adopted sons of the spider ladies, the beetle captain earned
his rank through his own valor. Perhaps this was what made him stubborn,
quick to anger over slights to his status. He often quarreled with the lesser
guais over matters of words and etiquette. They called him arrogant and
overbearing behind his back, disliking him all the more.

One day, a petty dispute drove him to brandish his twin sabers at the lesser
guards. The beetle commander chanced by and pulled him aside, "You
think your deeds and skills command their respect. But, know this, rank
has no bearing on the actions of others. What would happen if you
measured your worth by the regard of everyone? When stone spiders
show you disrespect, you'd think that makes you their inferior."

The captain retorted, "You're a commander, thus none dare offend you.
But I'm a minor officer. If I don't assert myself, those lesser ones will scorn
me even more."

The commander shook his head, "1f they treated you with greater
deference than me, would that make you my superior in practice and skill?
Nay, for I have observed that those who clamor most for respect often
receive the least of it."

What became of the beetle captain? Alas, he remained as he ever was, as
one's nature could not be easily altered. It was said that he continued to
contend with all who crossed his path until at last, he was never to be seen
again.
