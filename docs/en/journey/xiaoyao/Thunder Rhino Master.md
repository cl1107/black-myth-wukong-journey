# Thunder Rhino Master

> Green pines hold the lingering snow,
> Emerald flames guard the dim light's glow.
> Wandering beyond that sacred hill,
> True nature lies in temperance's will.

Along with the fall of the Yaksha Kingdom, the Rakshasa Kingdom, due to
their kinship with the yakshas, also met its end.

Thunder Rhino Masters was a descendant of the Rakshasas. Among his
relatives, many followed Princess Rakshasi. After her eastward migration,
Rakshasi had a new Daoist master in the Celestial Court. Practicing Daoism
in Buddhism's stead, Rakshasi marked a departure from her past. Thunder
Rhino Masters, unwilling to accept this change, heard that a branch of the
Yakshas was seeking Buddhist teachings in the New West and decided to
come here.

Unlike the Yakshas' free-spirited practice, Thunder Rhino Masters, though
an outer disciple, held their master in high regard and strictly adhered to
the temple's rules. Reaching the ultimate bliss was not their ultimate goal;
it was simply their nature to strive with all their efforts in everything they
do. Even when guarding the temple, they were relentless. If anyone
disturbed the temple's peace, the lightning they summon would pursue
and strike without mercy. Such individuals could sometimes inspire
admiration, but they could also be quite troublesome.
