# Enslaved Yaksha

> Oh, true kindness, how pure and bright!
> Yet karma binds in debts of blight.
> With halberd in hand, I fear their gaze,
> From humble roots, my sorrow stays.

In the northwest borderlands of the Kingdom of Yuetuo, there was a small
village where an elderly couple had been childless for many years. One
day, the old man went into the mountains to chop wood and discovered a
young child under an ancient tree. The child's skin was dark and his
appearance frightening, quite different from the village children. Seeing
his frail limbs and body covered in scars, the old man assumed he was a
refugee and brought him home.

The old woman also found the child unusual and initially wanted to send
him away. However, after washing, dressing, and feeding him, she
couldn't help but feel some affection for him. After some discussion, the
couple decided to keep him.

At first, the couple treated the child very well. But within half a year, due
to his strange appearance, the villagers began to gossip and called him
"Ugly Slave." The old couple, feeling ashamed, also started to treat him
less kindly and even called him the same way as the villagers did. Within
two years, his skin turned a dark green, and the couple made him wear
thick clothes to cover his entire body, forbidding him to take them off
even in the scorching heat.

Three years later, the Ugly Slave grew more robust, and horns began to
sprout from his head. The old man, increasingly fearful, confined him to
the woodshed. Whenever he was angry, he would enter and whip the
child, sometimes even using a hatchet to cut off his horns, leaving him
covered in blood. The old woman, disgusted by the sight, blamed
everything on the child. She would beat him when upset and even burn
him with fire when she felt ashamed. The Ugly Slave endured this torment
in the woodshed for another five years.

One day, a group of wandering yakshas passed by and heard curses in the
yaksha tongue coming from the woodshed. They broke in and found their
tormented kin. They gave the Ugly Slave a long halberd, and in his fury, he
stormed into the house and repaid the old couple for all they had done to
him.

Years later, the Ugly Slave's resentment still simmers, and only by
tormenting his prey can he find any semblance of joy.
