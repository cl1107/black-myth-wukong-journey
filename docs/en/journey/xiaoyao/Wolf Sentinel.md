Long ago, the Wolf Sentinels were the personal guards of old Lingxuzi.
They were masters of the long-hafted axe, and their name was spoken in
awe among the yaoguais.

When the Black Wind King returned from Guanyin and rebuilt the
garrison in the mountain, he took in many wolf guais who had wandered
here from Shituo Ridge. This angered the wolf guais native to Black Wind
Mountain. To appease them, the Black Bear Guai pledged to revive old
Lingxuzi. The wolf guais then had no choice but to endure in silence. Yet
mere days after the awakening, the old wolf vanished, and no one had
seen him since. Upon learning of this, the black bear did not look into the
matter but allowed a senior grey wolf guai from the Kingdom of Shituo to
take old Lingxuzi's seat and even his name.

This roused the local wolf guais to fury and launched protest after protest.
To their surprise, the Wolf Sentinels, at the Black Bear Guai's behest,
seized the lesser guais who led the unrest. The new Lingxuzi flew into a
rage at these guais, threatening to devour them whole. They were spared
this fate only by the timely arrival of Guangzhi, the Fireblade Wolf.
Thereafter, under the new Lingxuzi's command, the Wolf Sentinels led
every patrol of lesser guais on the mountain. Never did anyone ever dare
rise against Lingxuzi again.
