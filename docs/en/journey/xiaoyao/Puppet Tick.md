Tales told of Zhu's Estate in Webbed Ridge, the ancestral home of the
wealthy textile family in the Kingdom of Zhuzi. Rumors claimed the estate
housed vast amounts of gold and jewels, but those riches were never
found.

In the Kingdom of Zhuzi lived two thieves who called each other brothers.
The elder, a broad and forthright soul; the younger, a handsome and
clever spirit. Fleeing a warrant, they sought Zhu's Estate in the mountains
as their next target as well as a hideout. For days, they scoured the hills,
their rations spent, and their hope lost. Weary and famished, they
chanced upon a tea hut. The young thief called out, "Let's rest there,
brother!" The elder replied, "We've seen no one for days; how could there
be a tea hut?" But driven by hunger, the young one hastened toward it.

The elder chased after him, pleading. They tussled until they entered the
hut. Crude and dirty, it had rough log tables and stone stools. There were
no patrons inside, only a hunchbacked old man with a cane brewing tea.
The young thief asked, "How do you sell tea here with no one around, old
man?" The old man pointed to a dim village behind the hut. "This humble
one lives in the hilltop village. This hut serves but to eke out my living." He
then served two bowls of thick, strange-smelling brew. The young thief
reached for one, but the elder stopped him and asked the old man, "Do
you know of Zhu's Estate?" The old man grinned, ""It lies within the
village. Drink your tea, and I shall guide you there."" The young thief
beamed, but the elder grew warier. He snatched the bowl from the young
one. "I shall try it first." With that, he downed it in one gulp.

No sooner had the tea hit his belly than he collapsed, writhing in agony.
The young thief turned to the old man, only to witness his true form
revealed as a hunchbacked, cane-wielding creature, its body entangled in
silk. Lifting his eyes, he saw a colossal spider perched in the rafters,
tugging the strands to prompt the bug to tap its cane with a resonant
"ting-ting." At this signal, the stone stools shifted and unfurled their legs.
They became little stone spiders. They spat silk at the elder thief to
entangle him. At this sight, the younger thief turned and fled, as if he had
not heard his brother's pleas for help.
