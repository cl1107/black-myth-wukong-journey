# Jackal Soldier

> Life was hard, and hardships transcend.

The newly forged soul, having barely accustomed to his armors yet, heard
that the Jade Emperor, in his fury, had dispatched a hundred thousand
celestial soldiers to descend and subdue yaoguais. Fearing that he was not
yet skilled with his weapon, the celestial captain gave him an iron bow and
instructed him to stay at the rear and shoot arrows.

Descending to the mortal realm with the others, he saw banners flying and
weapons gleaming. Eighteen celestial nets covered the mountains, and it
seemed all celestial beings, be their constellation officers or admiral had
come to surround the area tight. The battle raged with relentless fury,
sand and stones whirling through the air. The sky and earth darkened as
dust and debris filled the universe.

The newly recruited celestial soldier had barely fought when a powerful
force stunned him. When he awoke, he found himself in front of a tower
behind the Tushita Palace corridor. Two Daoist boys were carrying him
inside. A Daoist boy greeted him with a smile, "Luckily, your armor isn't
ruined, or you couldn't be healed." As he spoke, the boy pushed him into a
mold, arranged the armor pieces, and poured boiling metal over him
again.

Emerging from the quenching pool, a lightning flash sent him back to the
battlefield.

Dazed and still in pain, the new soldier stood on the battlefield, unsure of
which celestial deity had struck him again with a golden wave, and he
found himself once more in front of the Tushita Palace tower.
After that, he was burned, drowned, and shocked, but each time his armor
remained whole. Hence, he was reforged and sent back to the battlefield
again.

Unbearable! He grabbed a weapon from the ground, finally resolving that
he could not suffer alone. Rebelling against the Celestial Court seemed the
only way out.
