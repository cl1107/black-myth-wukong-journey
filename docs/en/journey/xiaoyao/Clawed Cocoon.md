In the Kingdom of Zhuzi, a curious tale prevailed. No matter how many
kings came and went, the Zhu family of the Royal Weaving Office never
relocated. They wove a fabric known as Celestial Silk, gleaming as
moonlight, light as clouds. Nobility and merchants alike clamored for it.
The city's weavers seethed with jealousy, but none could replicate it. Over
time, whispers spread that the Zhus owed their skill to a jade shuttle,
bestowed by the Red-clad Immortal.

One weaver was convinced that obtaining that shuttle would also secure
his fortune. On a deep, dark night, he sneaked into the Zhu's workshop
outside the city walls during the second watch.

The Zhus were rich enough to have their workshop sprawled wide and
vast. In the dead of night, not a soul was in sight. The weaver crept
through the yards of draping silks when a pure white light fell upon the
center of the drying racks. The moon dimmed, and darkness swallowed all
but that single, shining pillar joining earth and sky.

The weaver stumbled toward it and discovered the pillar of light was made
of countless strands of silk. Two monstrous silkworms were spinning
these strands into cocoons and hanging them on the drying racks. The
cocoons' hooked feet grabbed the silk strands and passed a jade shuttle
back and forth, weaving the exquisite fabric. Dazed, the weaver became
fixated on the shuttle, convinced that owning it would endow him with
the same power. But the cocoons impaled him with their sharp hooks in a
blink of an eye. As he lay dying, he saw the worms crawling toward him.
They carried him into the pillar of light and wrapped him a luminous
cocoon.
