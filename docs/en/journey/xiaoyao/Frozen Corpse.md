# Frozen Corpse

> Wisdom's lamp lights seasons' span,
> Time flows like water through our hands.
> Snow and wind obscure the way,
> Achievements drift like bubbles, grand.
> The temple rules state: New monks entering the temple may receive a new

One day, Master Non- Void joyfully welcomed a new disciple and
personally led him to the storeroom to fetch a kasaya.
The young disciple found that the kasaya was made of a single layer of
cloth, hardly adequate for the snowy mountains. He asked, "Master, this
thin kasaya seems suitable for summer. Could I exchange it for a woolen
one?"

Non- Void shook his own kasaya and said, "The one I wear is the same as
the one in your hands, only more ornate. With the Buddha's wisdom in
your heart, you shall fear the cold no more."

The young disciple, still doubtful, asked, "Master, I saw many seniors
frozen to death by the roadside..."

Non- Void kindly replied, "Their understanding was shallow, and minds
unsteady. Yet you are different. I can see that you have the potential to
comprehend the Buddha's wisdom." The young disciple, feeling proud,
happily followed his master back with the kasaya.

Not long after, another frozen corpse appeared outside the temple gate. As
Non-Void led his new disciple past it, the young disciple asked, "Master,
did these seniors all freeze to death?"

Non-Void continued walking slowly and said, "Fear not, my disciple. They
lacked piety and wisdom, but you are different..."
