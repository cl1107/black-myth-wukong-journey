In the southern camp of the Kingdom of Yuetuo, near the western side of
the Flaming Mountains, a cook in the army was tasked with delivering
food to the soldiers each and every day. During his routine, he often
noticed a shadowy figure trailing him. When his courage led him to
confront it, he discovered it was a pottery figurine, armed with an
arrowless bow-a truly peculiar sight.

It is known that only the guilty are haunted. The cook, assured of his clear
conscience, demanded, "Why do you always follow me?" The figurine,
faceless yet speaking from within, replied, "In a past life, we were from the
same town and served together in the army. I was wounded by an enemy
arrow and you abandoned me. I was left to succumb to infection and die.
My resentment prevented me from reincarnation, and Yama, the King of
the Underworld, made me a revenant. I have come now for your life."

Puzzled, the cook asked, "Then why not kill me?" The figurine raised its
bow, replying, "This bow shoots only arrows of punishment. You've been
reasonably upright in this life, so I find no arrow to strike you. My only
choice now is to linger aimlessly." The cook asked if there was anything he
could do to stop its wandering, but the figurine spat back, "It was your
fault. You should atone, not 'help' me. Your debt will clear once you've
recited Buddha's name for me ten thousand times and kneeled to each.
Then, I may find peace."

Enraged by such entitlement, the cook argued, "Your fall in enemy hands
wasn't my arrow; your failure to evade wasn't my push. Leaving you was a
choice, not a crime. Why blame me?" With that, he smashed the pottery
figurine with his meal lid. The figurine shattered and turned to dust in the
wind.
Alas, even ghosts dread violence. Reflecting on one's actions is essential,
and kindness is a virtue. But beware of being exploited for your good
heart, lest the accused becomes the accuser.
