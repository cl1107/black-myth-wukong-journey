# Clay Vajra

> With an iron trident, a wrathful Vajra stands,
> Angry eyes blazing, a fiery fearsome brand.
> All beings bear their sins, for that is what they say,
> Burn them, guilty all, for peace to truly stay.

The Buddhist scriptures describe the Vajra as a guardian warrior of the
Buddha, tasked with upholding justice and eradicating sin.
Since the fat monk in yellow took back the New Thunderclap Temple,
magnificent new pavilions and pagodas were built to hold gatherings of
his devotees and attract more believers.

During one such gathering, two devotees met for the first time in the main
hall. Upon seeing each other, they immediately felt a surge of suspicion
and wariness. At that moment, the abbot had a statue of a Vajra carried in.
The statue stood on four legs, wielding a steel trident, with a wrathful
expression, but it had a peculiar hole in its chest.

The abbot introduced the statue, explaining that it was newly crafted and
imbued with a particular spiritual power that could discern right from
Wrong. One of the devotees hurried to the Vajra and said, "May the Vajra
eradicate all deceitful swindlers in the world and grant me justice." This
man was known for being gullible and often fell victim to ruses, yet he
never dared to seek retribution.

The other devotee quickly followed, saying, "May the Vajra eradicate
those who gain unfair advantages and then complain incessantly, granting
me peace." This man was a dishonest merchant who frequently sold
substandard goods and was often persecuted and cursed by his customers.

Hearing each other's wishes, the two began to argue fiercely in front of the
statue. The Vajra's eyes suddenly moved, and with a swift motion of its
trident, it killed both men. Flames then erupted from its four legs,
incinerating their bodies completely.
News of this event spread quickly, shocking the folks around the temple.
Some accused the abbot of using sorcery to deceive people, while others
praised his profound Buddhist wisdom and extraordinary powers.
Regardless, no one dared to disrespect him.
