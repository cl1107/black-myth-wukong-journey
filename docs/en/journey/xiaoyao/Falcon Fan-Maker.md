According to their clan rules, every gyrfalcon must learn the art of crafting
these vessels. Those who refuse are stripped of their titles and exiled from
the clan. To encourage innovation, the clan holds an annual competition
where the quality of vessels produced determines one's status within the
clan. One gyrfalcon, whose ancestors were all commoners, dreamt of
creating a treasure fan to elevate his status to nobility.

He spared no feathers to enhance the power of his vessel. After much
hardship, he finally crafted a fan and won the competition, becoming the
clan leader. However, he had plucked all his feathers and could no longer
fly, eventually resorting to wearing clothes to cover his baldness.

On the day of his succession, the Celestial Crane Immortal, head of the
feathered tribe in the upper realm, came to bestow a Celestial Registry
Tablet upon him. Proud of his fan, the new leader boasted to the Crane
Immortal. The Crane Immortal then lent him the Plantain Fan, saying,
"This is a failed creation of Lord Lao. Since you also make fans, I gift it to
you." After the Crane Immortal left, the clan leader tried the fan and was
immediately disheartened by its immense power. He no longer wanted his
clan members to use their feathers to make fans.

He led his followers away from the snowy peaks to search for plantain
leaves. Eventually, they found some near the New West and, imitating the
Crane Immortal's method, created many replicas, and regained his ability
to fly.
