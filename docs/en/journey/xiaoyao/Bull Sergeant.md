# Bull Sergeant

> Guarding jade doors with gold's radiant shine.
> Tangled in those worldly gains,
> All splendor fades, like dust, it wanes.

Through the ages, those seeking rain from the Plantain Fan often
presented gifts and tributes. As the chief guard in Rakshasi's court, the Bull
Sergeant was in charge of collecting these offerings.

The quality of the tributes greatly affected the well-being of the
mountains' yaoguais throughout the year. Thus, the Bull Sergeant always
schemed to influence the tributes towards his own preferences. One day,
leaning on the doorframe and sighing deeply, he noticed the smoke from
his nose resembled his beloved chicken and devised a plan.

He told all the tribute bearers that the shape of the smoke rising from
Flaming Mountains at dusk indicated what the Plantain Fan desired as
offerings. Believing this to be a divine sign, the people, despite their
hardships, started contributing exactly as the smoke suggested. The Bull
Sergeant received many of his desired items and reveled in a contented
life. However, over time, this led to growing discontent among the
villagers toward Rakshasi and her rains.

One day, Lady Rakshasi had to leave for a lecture by Lord Lao in the
Celestial Court and was unable to bring rain for the people. In panic, the
Bull Sergeant confessed his wrongdoings and begged for her forgiveness.
It turned out she never required any tributes; she naturally provided rain
for the villagers through the seasons for planting and growing. The whole
tribute scheme was a fabrication.

Lady Rakshasi didn't punish the Bull Sergeant but ordered him to return
the goods and tell the truth to the villagers. But they refused to take back
their offerings; instead, they urged the Sergeant to convince the Plantain
Fan for more rain. Caught between the villagers and the Lady, the
Sergeant ended up berated by both sides: the bull scorned by all.
