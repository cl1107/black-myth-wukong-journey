> They know it all when they see your core.

In the Kingdom of Pure Joy, there dwelled a high official from a lineage of
glory. His father, a beacon of honor and privilege, has passed recently. Not
long after, the official himself met a sudden death.

His soul, bewildered, found itself in the depths of the underworld,
surrounded by terrifying sights. He came to a halt before a colossal stone
gate, and peered inside. There, he saw charred corpses on their knees,
twisted and shrunken from the relentless flames, their faces erased under
chains and shackles. Among them, one scorched figure struggled to rise,
shouting, "Zirong, my son, it's me, your father!"

Better, the official's childhood name, resonated with truth. He hastily
asked, "Father, why are you here? I held so many rituals made for your
passage." The charred spirit replied, "They're futile. Virtues in life bring
fortune in the next, but wrongdoings must be paid now. My misdeeds
caused many deaths, and Yama condemned me to the ceaseless depths, to
burn eternally. My son, do not follow my path."

Then, five more charred spirits emerged, his ancestors going back to his
great-great-grandfather, all echoing the same warning. Suddenly, a
chilling wind blew, and the stone gate slammed shut. The official awoke
back among the living. For a time, he lived modestly, yet the hardships of
simplicity soon wore him down. Convincing himself that it was nothing
more than a dream, he slipped back into his lavish ways.
