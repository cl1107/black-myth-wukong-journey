# Wolf Stalwart

> Neither sky cares, nor earth will hold,
> By liquor's laugh, bold spirits unfold.
> In drunken dreams, a cosmos wide,
> Wake with worries cast aside.

Rare was the revelry for the minor guais who patrolled the mountain
paths, their delights not granted but taken in human guise, thieving
sustenance from unsuspecting townsfolk. The charade proved fleeting,
for the villagers grew wise to their deceit, and the guais, oft caught mid-
bite, were met with the town's rugged justice, deterring their mischief.

Among them was a wolf guai with a penchant for drink, who, on a day of
indolence, lay beneath an ancient tree. Suddenly, an elder wolf, cloaked in
feathers of a crane, appeared to him asking, "Why forsake your patrol for
idleness?" The wolf guai sighed, "1 long for drink, but the townsfolk see
through me; I'm left to quench my thirst only in my dreams." The elder
chuckled as he whispered a secret, "Seek the shrine. Conceal yourself
behind the curtains, and the sacred spirits' liquor shall be yours to drink."
Then, with a shift of form, he vanished.

Wavering in doubt, the wolf guai transformed and hurried to the town's
shrine. There, veiled behind curtains, a sacred effigy stood, its origins
unknown, the altar laden with delectable offerings and fine spirits. As
advised, he nestled himself between the curtains, indulging in the liquor
until his belches betrayed him to the gathering crowd in the shrine.
Trapped between the curtains, the wolf guai listened as a voice rang out,
"The wine jar I offered is empty. Our tributes were received." A chorus of
prayers erupted, beseeching favor from the Immortals.

From that day forth, folks from miles around flocked to the shrine,
affording the demon endless drink. But as days passed, the once delightful
treat turned bitter; and those prayers, be them piteous or greedy, weighed
heavily upon him with helplessness.

One day, unable to endure the bitterness any longer, the wolf guai burst
from behind the curtains, hoisting the jar and smashing it on the altar
amidst the screams of onlookers. With a deafening crash, he suddenly
awoke beneath the tree: no shrine, no incense, no crowd around. With a
tired sigh, he took up his axe and set off to patrol the mountains once
more.
