# Rat Governor

> Through omens, he sensed impending blight,
> Yet he turned away, veering from the light.
> Unaware, the days of plenty ceased to flow,
> The nation, infested with rodents, lost its glow.

In same year that Kingdom of Sahali was renamed as Kingdom of Flowing
Sands, the "Rodent Reverence Edict" was proclaimed throughout the
country. This edict declared rats as celestial beings protected by the king's
law, making it illegal to harm them. Whosoever breached this
commandment would face the king's judgment. Hence, rat guais from
across the land flocked to the kingdom. Although strife ensued between
commoners and guais, none dared defy the king's decree. For the well-
being of people, the scholars of the Royal Academy planned a petition to
implore the segregation of rat guais to the southwest corner of the capital.

Among these scholars, there was an elder who was deeply skilled in
divination. On the day of the petition, right before the scholars were to
meet the king, the elder divined for his career, which came out as a grave
omen. "Not an auspicious time for it," he told his students the omen in
secret, "I advise you to take sick leave with me today". However, his
students, faithful and young, heeded him not and went forth gallantly.

Just as the elder stepped outside the palace, the Royal Guards encircled
the hall. Shouts of agony then filled the air, unfolding the bloodshed
within. Hands covering his trembling ears, the elder slowly made his way
home. After three kingless assemblies and a major court reshuffle, he was
promoted to Grand Governor, a rank that bestowed him years of wealth
and glory. But one day, as he peered into a bronze mirror, he noticed that
his nose was elongated, and bristles had sprouted on both sides.

Henceforth, he forsook mirrors, knowing he would always bear a rat's
visage like all those absented from that petition.
