# Turtle Treasure

> The human heart swings good and ill,
> With wealth and treasure, freedom's thrill.
> Riding a hammer to the sky,
> Tell me, is it strange or nigh?

Years ago, in Village of Chen, a villager went out one day and saw a
peculiar man standing by the roadside, holding a rope tied to a white soft-
shelled turtle. Passers-by came and went, but no one paid any attention to
this strange sight.

The villager pretended not to notice and tried to hurry past, but the white
turtle at his feet let out a pitiful cry. In his compassion, he argued with the
peculiar man and eventually bought the white turtle, releasing it back into
the water.

That night, the villager had a dream in which the white turtle vomited out
a tiny person with blue-purple skin and an ugly face. The tiny person ran
towards the villager, startling him awake.

After that, the villager began to change. His eyes could see occasional
glimmers of light in the mountains and fields, and his appetite grew
immensely, along with his strength. One day, he took a shovel and dug
into the ground, discovering a coffin filled with valuable artifacts. This
unexpected found bestowed hiss great wealth.

One night, the white turtle appeared in his dream again, letting out a cry.
The villager felt his stomach churn and vomited out the tiny person with
blue-purple skin. The tiny person fell to the ground and hurried towards
the white turtle. Realizing something, the villager grabbed the tiny person
and swallowed him back down. The white turtle called out a few more
times, but the villager covered his mouth, refusing to let the tiny person
out. After a tense stand-off, the villager woke up again.

Over time, the villager's appearance became increasingly abnormal,
forcing him to wear an iron mask to hide his face. Eventually, even his skin
turned blue-purple, and he fled into the mountains, carrying specially
made tools to search for more treasures.

Interestingly, on his treasure-hunting journey, he discovered that he was
not the only one with such an experience, which brought him some
comfort.
