Outside the walls of the Kingdom of Sacrifice, atop the mountains, stood
the Fumefire Temple. Renowned for its ability to reform wayward youths
from fallen households, the temple was spoken highly of for guiding lost
souls toward righteous paths. This tale, as told by a landowner, is about
one such disciple, Zhao San.

Zhao San was a vagabond. He beguiled guests of brothels into lavish
spending, and one of his patrons turned out to be Landowner Wang's son.
He soon found himself pursued by the authorities and facing a trial against
Wang. A Daoist from the Fumefire Temple happened upon him and
offered sanctuary.

From that point forward, Zhao San immersed himself in the pursuit of
wisdom, practiced diligently, and dutifully undertook tasks assigned by
his master. One day, when he descended the mountain on an errand, he
came across Meiniang, a concubine being mistreated by the wife of a
household during their journey to the temple. Without hesitation, Zhao
San intervened, rescued Meiniang, and brought her to the temple to
shield her from the cruelty of that family.
With nowhere else to turn, Meiniang was welcomed into the temple by
the master and became a disciple. Filled with gratitude for Zhao San saving
her life, she tended to the temple's chores. Over time, she repeatedly
sought to become Zhao San's spiritual partner, yet her advances were
always rebuffed.

Years later, having made significant spiritual progress, Zhao San
underwent an ascension ceremony organized by his master, with
Meiniang invited as a witness. They were taken to a mountain peak with a
river of fire flowing down. Zhao San received a talisman from his master
and courageously leaped into the fire. Filled with a longing to practice
alongside him, Meiniang followed suit amidst cheers and blessings.

As the smoke rose, they were reborn from the blazing flames as the eternal
guardians of the river of lava. Thus, in the fiery embrace, they found
immortality and everlasting life, forever part of the river's endless flow.
