# Black Bear Guai

> In Guanyin's grove, his greed won't cease,
> Southern tides bring no release.
> Schemes cloud his sight,

On Bodhi Peak, he learnt life's worth is peace.
In the Purple Bamboo Grove where Guanyin resided, life was usually
tranquil. The Black Bear Guai spent his days eating bamboo shoots with
aster and drinking homemade bamboo leaf brew. His days had become so
unremarkable, they almost faded into nothingness.

One day, the Loong Princess paid him a sudden visit with Red Boy, her
servant. Flustered, the black bear hastily gathered his dishes, trying to hide
the mess.

The Loong Princess rolled her eyes and asked, "Have you thought about
the task Guanyin mentioned to you a few days ago?"

Black Bear Guai didn't answer. He simply retrieved a box out of the chest
and handed it to the Loong Princess. Red Boy snatched it and opened it.
Inside was a transparent, honey-fried sugar sculpture of an immortal
riding a lion, known as a "lion immortal candy".
"Yesterday, there was a Dharma assembly. At the top of the feast, there
was this exquisite and eye-catching sugar sculpture. I specially saved it for
you, as a token of my respect."

"Do you presume to understand my tastes? Keep this for the children."
Hearing this, Red Boy lost interest and stuffed the box back into Black Bear
Guai's arms. Only then did the Loong Princess let out a contemptuous
laugh.

Cognizant of his blunder, Black Bear Guai mumbled, "I'm willing to serve,
but my abilities are mediocre. I'm afraid I can't handle such an important
matter..." The Loong Princess replied, "Do you think we don't know that?
Don't worry, there will be those fiercer and more ruthless than you
leading the charge."

"No work, no reward. If it's a thorny matter, I might not be able to handle
it."

"Guanyin will attend to all. No thorny matters shall prevail."

"Do not try to fool me. Guanyin instructed me to practice quietly here.
Why would she intervene?"

The Loong Princess wore a long face and said, "How can you be so timid?
This is a great opportunity. More people are vying for it than you could
even imagine. Guanyin chose you only because she wanted someone she
could trust. Can't you see that?"

Black Bear Guai was speechless for a long time. The Loong Princess had
run out of patience. "So little ambition. Forget it! Forget it! I'll let Guanyin
know."

"Dear Princess, honorable Princess, that's not what I meant. I'll go!"

Only when she saw the eager look in Black Bear Guai's eyes did the
princess roll her eyes again. Leaving Red Boy behind, she drifted away.
Seeing her leave, Red Boy hastily asked Black Bear Guai, "What exactly is
this task? I want to leave. Why don't you tell Guanyin and take me with
you?"

"It's a matter of great importance. But as you just heard, Guanyin didn't
want you to go. Don't pester me anymore. I don't want to lose this
opportunity for your sake."

A few days later.

Black Bear Guai had finished his preparations. Wielding a black-tasseled
spear, he was about to set off. Red Boy, who had been waiting outside the
bamboo grove for days, hurriedly caught up with him and once again
insisted on accompanying him.

Contrary to his usual manner, Black Bear Guai tried to persuade him, "Red
Boy, Guanyin has instructed that you must stay here. Even your father has
been pressed into service this time. Surely you can see how perilous it is;
this is no laughing matter." He touched the Encaging Band around his
head and sighed, "To risk one's life just to remove a headband? It's not
worth it."

With that, he transformed his body into a black wind and swiftly vanished,
paying no heed to Red Boy's desperate shouts.

Afterward, Red Boy waited for him outside the bamboo grove for a long
time, but he never saw him return. Later, when Red Boy recalled, he
realized that it was the last time he ever saw Black Bear Guai in Guanyin's
place.
