# The Red Loong

> Smoke rises high, from wood afire.
> Hit the back, let the beats respire, as in mist, thunders conspire.

After the case of the Old Loong King of Jing River was settled, the loong
princes found themselves facing an uncertain future. Following the
journey west, rewards were given based on merit, but only the loong
princes alone awaited judgment, heightening their anxiety. They sought
out Yuan Shoucheng and asked him for a sign of their fortunes. The signs
showed "The loong lies hid; not a time for action," which became a thorn
in their hearts. Among them, the most concerned were the Four Loongs
who governed the four rivers and knew well the might of those above.
They took the initiative to resign, hoping to save their lives by retreating.
Yet, the letters they submitted to the Celestial Court were all returned.
Time flew by, and one day, Yuan Shoucheng sought out the Four Loongs.
He relayed that the signs had shifted to "The loong lies hid; it stirs in the
deep", indicating a favorable time for action. Upon hearing this, the Four
Loongs left their underwater abode and went their separate ways to plan
their next moves.

The Red Loong was quite astute. Knowing that Black Bear Guai was greedy
for treasures and had the protection of Guanyin, he bartered all his
valuable possessions with Black Bear Guai in exchange for an ideal cave
nestled in the mountains. Afterward, he went into seclusion in the cave
and slept for many years.

One day, he awoke and wanted to soar up the sky and stretch his body
again, but he found that he could hardly climb the clouds. He
remembered an ancient saying: "When a loong wishes to ascend to the
sky, it must first climb the claw-wood." He wielded his thunderbolt tail to
carve out a set of claw-wood in the mountains to help him fly, but it was
still to no avail.
The Red Loong was unwilling to accept defeat and sought help from Black
Bear Guai. Although Black Bear Guai was not good at flying, he couldn't
resist the chance for profit that presented itself. He sold the Boshan
Censer he had brought from Guanyin's place to the Red Loong, claiming
that the censer could create clouds and smoke. He cited a passage from
ancient texts to persuade the Red Loong: "Aloong cannot traverse
without clouds."

The Red Loong believed this to be true. He embedded the censer on his
back and burned his Will to forcibly create smoke from it. When one
censer was not enough, he added another. Each time the censers emitted
smoke, they greatly consumed his Will, yet the help they provided was
very limited. Although the Red Loong could use it to fly again, the flight
could never compare to that of the old days. He could only reside wearily
among the claw-woods.

Alas, to think that the world harbors such vexing realities. A skill once
mastered can fade with neglect. Such is the nature of all knowledge: if not
applied, it withers away to nothing in the end. How lamentable!
