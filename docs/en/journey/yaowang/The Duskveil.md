He lay on the ground, still unsure of how he had been defeated. The
previously unremarkable Daoist-robed insect guai, whom he had
previously dismissed as insignificant, now stood before him with a smirk
on this face.

Seeing the guai holding a radiant golden hairpin, he suddenly understood.
He wanted to ask a question but found he couldn't speak. The pain was
unbearable; it seemed that his throat was slit by the ville insect with the
hairpin.

He should be dying. He closed his eyes, not wanting his last sight to be that
hideous face.

Unexpectedly, someone turned him over and carefully applied decoction
to his wound. He could breathe again, but this brought him no relief.

The guai clicked its tongue in amazement. "The medicine Master gave is
truly remarkable. It has mended the severed part completely. What a pity
to use it on this one."

He opened his eyes and tried to ask a question, but the guai stopped him.
"Don't rush. External medicine can't heal internal injuries. Besides, I don't
intend to cure you."

With that, the guai waved its hand, and two fake Daoists in green robes
carried over a jade box covered with brocade.

The guai took out a golden cocoon and said, "We mountain guais are
unworthy of this item. It's best to test it on you."

Panic-stricken, he coughed up blood, which splattered onto the golden
cocoon.

The cocoon broke upon contact with the blood, and a worm with a human
head and a golden body emerged, quickly squirmed into the grass and
disappeared.

The guai remained unperturbed and pulled out another golden cocoon
from the jade box. "Master was truly wise to have prepared two golden
cocoons."

He tried to struggle, but his body was tightly bound by cobweb. The guai
commanded, "Pour it down his throat."

The fake Daoists brought several buckets of water and forced his head
back, pouring some foul-smelling concoction into his mouth. He felt
something go down his throat.

After swallowing it, he felt as if he were floating on clouds, his mind
becoming hazy.

Apart from a lingering concern for his mother, he could hardly remember
anything. He silently recited one last prayer, hoping that a glimmer of
survival would be bestowed upon his mother.
