The grey wolf guai of the temple was once an exile from the Kingdom of
Shituo. When Shituo was laid to ruin, the wolves fed, following the grey
wolf on a long and weary road, until they found shelter under the banner
of the Black Wind King.

Unlike the old Lingxuzi, who pursued immortality and detachment, the
grey wolf cared nothing for the ways of deities and Buddha, nor for the
empty promises of eternal life. Instead, his heart was set on mastering
strength and skill. He honed his craft with iron claws and fangs until he
could strip the very flesh from the bones of his foes.

When the old Lingxuzi vanished, Black Bear Guai saw fit to elevate the
grey wolf to be the new master of the wolf guais, giving him the name
Lingxuzi and tasking him with guarding the Guanyin Temple.
The wolf guais who came with the new Lingxuzi from the Kingdom of
Shituo also rose in power and surpassed those who had served longer in
the distribution of spoils and favors. The local wolf guais had little
affection for the ways of the new Lingxuzi, and after finding themselves
thrust aside, bitterness took root in their hearts. In their shared sense of
grievance, they found a new unity of purpose. Often they gathered in
secret, comforting each other, sharing the old memories when the old
master was in power, and quietly plotting against the new one.
But Lingxuzi was prepared. Under the pretense of a roll call, he gathered
the local wolf guais in the temple and gave the signal to his loyal guards to
seize the malcontents. The temple erupted into chaos. Lingxuzi then
leaped down from the roof into the crowd, ready to devour all who dared
to betray him.

The Fireblade Wolf, hearing the commotion, rushed over and managed to
hold Lingxuzi off and bought the minions time to flee to safety. When
Black Wind King learned of this, he was ready to unleash punishment
upon the rebellious wolf guais, but the snake guai mediated, and peace
was restored. Yet from that day forth, the local wolf guais refused to tread
even within the shadow of the walls of Guanyin Temple.
