# Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master

> Tending the furnace, stoking the flame,
> Making pills, to immortality aspire.
> Countless eyes and countless schemes,
> One misstep, and shatter all dreams.

"Will this...work?" Violet Spider lowered her head, not daring to look
directly at Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master.

The master handed a needle to the old woman and said softly, "With what
the monkey left behind and this vessel mine, you have nothing to worry
about. If both fail, come to me, and I will back you up."

He paused, as if a new thought had struck him, and added, "If I act first,
you will never see that pig again...

Hearing this, the old woman quickly took the needle, thanked him, and
left.

Once the door closed, an immortal with a red scalp and a crane face came
in, holding a fly-whisk. He emerged from behind the screen, looking at the
master imposingly.

The master bowed respectfully and reported, "With that that pig in our
hands, the Destined One alone will not cause any trouble."

The Crane Immortal remained non-committal and sighed, "Your little
schemes are all under His Majesty's watchful eyes. He hasn't intervened
out of respect for Her Majesty."

The master chuckled dryly and replied, "Her Majesty's words: they've
taken too much profit. This time, our principal and interest must be taken
back."

The Crane Immortal flicked his fly-whisk as if shooing away flies and said
leisurely, "Once it's done, you leave. But they still have to stay."

No expression could be seen on the master's face as he bowed deeply to
the immortal.
