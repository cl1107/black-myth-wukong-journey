# Yellow Wind Sage

> Endless yellow winds, sands stretch afar,
> In the land once abundant, no homes there are.
> Half-guai, half-immortal, who can decide?
> Thief or sage, why would he mind?

Firelight flickered over a table laden with food and drink.
The Second Prince of Flowing Sands, sitting on the table, gnawed on what
might have been half a haunch with relish.

The King of Flowing Sands sat beside his son obediently. As someone who
typically delighted in pointing out the missteps of others, he remained
oddly silent during the feast.

Even the Tiger Vanguard was on his best behavior. Watching the dimwit
across from him gorging on the haunch, the tiger seemed to have no
appetite.

The Yellow Wind Sage sat in the place of honor, one hand caressing the
object resting on the table: the head of a bodhisattva with eyes closed in
silence.

"Pa, I need more." The sudden shout from the Second Prince set all hearts
hammering. His pa, the King of Flowing Sands, glowered and hissed,
"Shut it!" Then he scrambled to his knees and pleaded for forgiveness.
"A trifle, is all." The Yellow Wind Sage rested his hand atop the head of
Lingji, then stood. "With my master's most prized vessel in my grasp, I can
surely absorb that thing. I mean to enter secluded meditation, starting
today. I have appeased those old rascals from above, yet it will be wise to
remain discreet"

"If you're seeking seclusion, Master," fawned the King of Flowing Sands,
"'my people and I would be honored to camp outside the cave and stand
guard beside you."

"Beside me?" The Sage gazed at his master's head and rejected his offer
immediately. "No, you will move to the ridge. I will be setting the Yellow
Wind Formation. Let no one disturb me."

"If..if there is urgent news, Master, how shall we bear it unto you?" The
King cried out.

The Yellow Wind pointed at the Tiger Vanguard. "Have your rock
brothers raise paths of sand, each with a gate locked by a secret tally. You
two vanguards will each hold a tally..."

Before Tiger Vanguard knelt to thank the Sage for this weighty charge, the
King interjected anxiously: "But Master! We rats have never got along
with those cats. If they hold the..."

The Yellow Wind Sage didn't want to listen at all. He picked up the
Buddha head and interrupted, "All of you, withdraw. Do not disturb me
until the very sky collapses."
