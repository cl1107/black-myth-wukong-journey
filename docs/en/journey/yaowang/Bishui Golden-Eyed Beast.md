# Bishui Golden-Eyed Beast

> With auspicious purple skin, a majestic sight,
> Mighty and fierce, like a tiger in fight.
> Ice and fire clash, a battle so dire,
> In scorching hills and frigid lands, a path of mire.

The Bull King sat on the mountaintop, utterly exhausted and unable to
move.

He watched as the Bishui Beast limped away from the battlefield. He
thought about calling out to it but decided against it.

His longest-serving mount had been heartlessly driven away by him,
without even a backward glance. His most trusted weapon had been taken
by his own son and discarded who knows where.

The Bull King glanced at the bloodstains on his body. His old wounds had
not yet healed, and now there were new ones. That brat's Firepoint skills
had improved again.

Initially, when the boy learned of his origins, he clamored for revenge
every day. Fearing that his son would bring about his own demise, the Bull
King had locked him up for a while and assigned the Bishui Beast to guard
him. Unexpectedly, Red Boy managed to escape, and by the time the Bull
King arrived, the beast had chased and fought him for quite a while,
leaving the boy pinned under its claws, barely alive.

It was the beast's fault for being so ruthless, forcing him to severely injure
it to save his son. What was wrong with that?

Fortunately, he had held back enough to let the reckless beast keep its life.
But who would have thought that the brat's injuries were faked?
Now, the tables had turned, and the son had imprisoned the father.
Retribution, it seems, does not come from the karma but from the hearts
of men.

"The one who wanted to save you, you drove away; the one who wanted
to kill you, you saved?"

A familiar voice echoed from the depths.

"Yes, you can save me, and I can save you too, but who will save us?" The
Bull King's head began to ache again.
