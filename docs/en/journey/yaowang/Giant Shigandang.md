In Mount Huaguo, after the birth of the Sage Stone Monkey, the remaining
celestial stone continued to absorb the essence of the sun and moon for a
thousand years. Through self-cultivation, it eventually transformed into a
yaoguai as large as a mountain.

This celestial stone originally possessed boundless divine power.
However, not long after its transformation, someone planted a fleshy
Buddha head on it. Since the emergence of this fleshy Buddha head, it had
constantly absorbed the Will from the celestial stone's body.

The celestial stone's spirit grew weary and had to burrow into the ground,
absorbing the pure essence of the earth to replenish itself. Over time, it
drained the surrounding mountains of their Will, causing flowers to
wither, leaves to fall, and all living beings to perish.
Meanwhile, the fleshy Buddha head, nourished by the celestial stone,
almost became the master of the stone body. Fully energized, it began to
develop the Skandha of Consciousness within. If it were to complete the
other four Skandhas, who knows how atrocious this celestial stone guai
would become.

Alas, this celestial stone, nurtured by the universe, ended up serving as a
mere vessel for the parasitic fleshy Buddha head. Perhaps this is what
people often refer to as fate and destiny.
