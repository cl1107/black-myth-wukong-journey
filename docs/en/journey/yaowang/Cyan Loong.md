# Cyan Loong

> With a sharp sword, Loong's Light it is called,
> Fishing alone in the bitterness, nothing caught.
> The hidden loong waits to soar the sky,
> Infallen to the dust, its fame will fly.

The boundless Bitter Lake, the Buddha's ferry saves only the willing.
Without the willingness, nothing can be done. The Cyan Loong, fishing
alone on Turtle General's back, is one such case.

When the Cyan Loong arrived in the New West seeking refuge, he briefly
encountered Yellowbrow. Disliking Yellowbrow's teachings on the path
to bliss, which he deemed utter nonsense, he knew better than to offend
him if he wished to stay in his domain. Thus, he claimed his intention to
fish in the Bitter Lake. If he could catch a living thing, it would signify his
bond with ultimate bliss, granting him the right to remain in the blessed
land undisturbed.

Yellowbrow knew this was merely a stalling tactic but found the idea
amusing and agreed to it, with one condition: once the fishing rod was
cast, it could not be moved, so as the fisher. If he moves, it would prove
that the Cyan Loong had ulterior motives and was deceitful, and he would
be immediately captured and sent to the dungeon.

The Cyan Loong readily agreed and kept his word. He transformed his
Loong Light Sword into a hookless fishing rod, sat on the turtle's back, and
did not move again.

Every day, the lesser guais would come to the turtle's back to check on
him, expecting that he would not last long in the cold and hunger. But
each time they came, they only saw the snow accumulating thicker and
thicker on his body until it completely covered him. The guais could not
understand why he would endure such hardship when a simple bow, or a
bit of minor contribution to Yellowbrow could earn him a comfortable
life.

Ah, there truly are people in this world who would rather endure a
thousand hardships than abandon their lofty aspirations. They carry a
World of their own in their hearts, unmoved by their circumstances.
