# Violet Spider

> The breeze by the frail bridge chills her delicate frame,
> Spring arrives, another bridal gown newly made.

Upon reaching a cluster of huts in the forest, Tang Monk decided to seek
alms for food. As he approached the village, he saw several women playing
with balls under a pavilion. Invited by them into their home, he was
suddenly thrown to the ground, tied up with ropes, and hung from a
beam in the most uncomfortable manner.

While climbing trees and branches, Sun Wukong turned back and saw a
glimmer of light, realizing that his master must have encountered
yaoguais. He summoned the local keeper for details and learned that the
glimmer was from the celestial bathing spring, which had been taken over
by seven spider guais. Knowing that they bathe three times a day, Sun
Wukong transformed into an eagle, swooped down, and stole all of their
clothes from the rack.

Bajie, seeing so many women's clothes, persistently inquired and learned
that seven guais were bathing. Overjoyed, he rushed to the spring.
Without any hesitation, he stripped off his black garb and jumped into the
water, transforming into a catfish guai. The spiders tried to catch him yet
none of them succeeded.

Recognizing one of them as an old acquaintance, Bajie mischievously
swam around her legs. He floated and dived around her until he was out
of breath and hazed.

The guais, retreating to their cave, fetched some old clothes and called
upon their seven adopted sons to guard the house while they headed to
the Temple of Yellow Flowers to seek aid. Meanwhile, Bajie retraced his
steps and reunited with the fellowship. Together, they defeated the insect
sons and freed their master. Without delay, they hurried to the Temple of
Yellow Flowers. The temple master, who had practiced alongside the
seven spider guais, learned that Tang Monk was a monk of ten lifetimes'
merits and that his fellow spiders were humiliated, prepared four cups of
poisoned tea, intending to exact revenge on the fellowship and ultimately
consume Tang Monk.

However, Sun Wukong saw through the ruse, overturned the tea cups,
and defeated the spider guais, forcing them to retreat. The Daoist master
then engaged in, prompting Wukong to order Bajie to eliminate the seven
spider guais in his stead. Following his command, Bajie wielded his rake
and struck down each of the spiders, sparing only the last one.
Remembering their brief affair in the water, he hesitated and, with a final
thrust of his rake into the ground, told her to flee for her life.
