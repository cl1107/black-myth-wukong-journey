# Black Wind King

> The future's dark, destiny's winds may shift,
> Each rise and fall comes in its drift.
> Once a guardian of the southern sea,
> Greed turned him to a slave of misery.

Since his return from Guanyin, the Black Wind King's spirit brimmed with
grand plans. He vowed to restore his might in the mountains. He knew
well that after years away, to win respect from the yaoguais, strength
alone would not make them bow. So he took many steps to try to earn
both awe and loyalty.

When he was with Guanyin, he learned the mantra of revival. Harnessing
the voluntary self-sacrifice of wolf guais, he brought back old Lingxuzi
from death. But that ungrateful old wolfleft only a few words after the
revival and vanished from his sight again.

The Black Wind King feared the wolf pack would fall apart without a
leader. He had to choose another wolf to head the pack. A grey wolf guai
who wandered here from Shituo Ridge, strong and in his prime, was a fine
choice. The Black Wind King gave him the name of Lingxuzi and helped
him take the seat. Yet, the wolf pack rose against their new master in the
temple, and it almost led to a bloodbath among kin.

In his frustration, the Black Wind King used the mantra to try and bring
back to life the old monk he used to practice with. But the soul of the
monk did not return to the stitched corpse. Instead, it fused with the gold,
silver, and copper coins the monk had buried in life, forming a maddened
golem. It wandered and disturbed the mountain garrison day after day,
never relenting.

The newly appointed White-clad Noble is far from ordinary. He typically
indulges in solitary reading and poetry. Despite his outward appearance of
loyalty and sincerity, he remains shrouded in mystery, making it
impossible for others to fathom his true intentions

Alas, to think too highly of oneself and then end up achieving nothing. It is
true that they say, a fool with ambition is worse than a nobody.
