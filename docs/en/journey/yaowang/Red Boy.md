# Red Boy

> On his red skin, talent may shine,
> Eyes glaring bright, a mischievous sign.
> Samadhi Fire forged, yet heart unrefined,
> The gate to Mount Lingshan lies within the mind.

For many years, Red Boy had been having the same nightmare. In his
childhood, he shared this nightmare with his mother.

"Mother, there were so many people, they were all coming to kill me!""

"My dear, once you fall asleep again, you'll forget all about it by
tomorrow."

Yet the boy was excited: "But I am very powerful. I defeated monks as tall
as mountains, strange birds, and fire-breathing statues... I am not afraid of
them at all."

"Oh, how brave you are, my dear!"

He continued: "1 dreamt that I grew up into an adult, with long horns on
my head and long spikes on my hands. I could kill a bunch of bad people at
once. But there were too many of them, I couldn't kill them all. Later,
some strange people I had never seen before came. They hung quietly in
the sky, not coming down, just silently watching me from above."

His mother pulled him into her arms: "If that day ever comes, your father
and I will go to the sky with you and kill them all."

"Will we die?"

"..."

"1 dreamt that they killed me, and I turned into a red lotus flower. And
mother, you picked this lotus flower, and I became your child again."

"..."

He continued to chatter: "Mother, if I die, would you be willing to give
birth to me again?"

"Don't you ever say this again!""
