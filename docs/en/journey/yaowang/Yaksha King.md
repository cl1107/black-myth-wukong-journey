# Yaksha King

> Fangs bared, eyes like twin lanterns bright,
> In battle's clash, he finds delight.
> Agile and brave, with skills so fine,
> Yet lost and wandering, his fate's decline.

The raging flames had reached the Golden Hall, and the sounds of battle
outside were deafening, though they were muffled within.

The king, gravely wounded, sat amidst the wreckage, holding a recently
deceased young boy in his arms.

A figure stood behind the curtain, sighing, "'Such devastation.. Don't you
see? It's all because of you."

The king remained silent.

"Whether the Yaksha royal lineage continues or ends depends entirely on
your decision today."

The king couldn't help but glance around the Golden Hall, still able to see
traces of its former glory.

"They say Yakshas are the most resolute, yet you, as their king, are hesitant
and indecisive."

The king gently stroked his son's face, the body still warm. He wished so
dearly that the boy could see the vast and beautiful world.

"If you have even a shred of linger desire, why not try my method? The
unattainable wish in your heart, I will take care of it for you."

As a king, was he not even allowed to die on the battlefield? The king
closed his eyes.

Finally, he opened them and said slowly, "Since there is no salvation... I
will leave me and my son at your disposal."

"Splendid! It's not too late to understand it now."

The figure clapped, and a white-clad Daoist emerged from behind. The
Daoist approached the Yaksha King, bowed, then sat cross-legged on the
ground. He extended his hands above the boy's head and began to chant
softly. Before long, a small, blood-red lotus flower emerged slowly from
the boy's forehead, crystal clear and vibrant. The Daoist carefully plucked
the lotus and placed it into a bowl he carried.

The Yaksha King fixed his unblinking gaze intently at the lotus.

The figure said, "This red lotus is the essence of your son's soul. To ensure
it does not dissipate before successful reincarnation, we will need your life
and the water from the River of Childbearing."

The Yaksha King raised his arm, taking one last look at the blood lotus.

"I will do it myself."

# Giant Shigandang

On stone peaks, a divine birth is found,
Yet its dual hearts keep wisdom bound.
To shake the sky and earth seems light,
But only with schemes known, does fortune take flight.

In Mount Huaguo, after the birth of the Sage Stone Monkey, the remaining
celestial stone continued to absorb the essence of the sun and moon for a
thousand years. Through self-cultivation, it eventually transformed into a
yaoguai as large as a mountain.

This celestial stone originally possessed boundless divine power.
However, not long after its transformation, someone planted a fleshy
Buddha head on it. Since the emergence of this fleshy Buddha head, it had
constantly absorbed the Will from the celestial stone's body.

The celestial stone's spirit grew weary and had to burrow into the ground,
absorbing the pure essence of the earth to replenish itself. Over time, it
drained the surrounding mountains of their Will, causing flowers to
wither, leaves to fall, and all living beings to perish.
Meanwhile, the fleshy Buddha head, nourished by the celestial stone,
almost became the master of the stone body. Fully energized, it began to
develop the Skandha of Consciousness within. If it were to complete the
other four Skandhas, who knows how atrocious this celestial stone guai
would become.

Alas, this celestial stone, nurtured by the universe, ended up serving as a
mere vessel for the parasitic fleshy Buddha head. Perhaps this is what
people often refer to as fate and destiny.
