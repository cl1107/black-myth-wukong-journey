# Kang-Jin Loong

> Halfway to the west, the journey long,
> Returning to the homeland, where dreams belong.
> Strengthen and weaken by the mighty sack,
> Principles falter, on a misguided track.

Kang-Jin Loong, one of the Twenty-Eight Constellations, is the second
constellation of the Azure Loong of the East. With a sharp horn on her
forehead, she once drilled through the Gold Cymbals to rescue the Great
Sage. Since then, the constellation officers have upheld the principle of
"staying sharp", leading many immortals to believe that some strange
influence had invaded their consciousness.

One day, during the roll call in the Dome of Stars, the Dawnstar was
missing. Despite thorough inquiries, no one knew his whereabouts.
Coincidentally, Yellowbrow returned to the New West to host a grand
ceremony, inviting various yaoguais, gods, immortals, and Buddhas to
attend. Hearing the news, Kang-Jin Loong sought permission from the
Celestial Court and attended the ceremony, intending to secretly
investigate the Dawnstar's disappearance. However, like the Dawnstar,
Kang-Jin Loong also vanished without a trace.

The constellation officers speculated and compared notes, realizing that
both the Dawnstar and Kang-Jin Loong had once done the Great Sage big
favors. They suspected a connection with the Great Sage. Reflecting on
their past interactions with the Great Sage, they grew fearful. Kui-Mu
Wolf scoffed, "Though that monkey ruined my plans, I still respect him.
But you all, who always boasted about your friendship with that monkey,
why are you silent now?"
