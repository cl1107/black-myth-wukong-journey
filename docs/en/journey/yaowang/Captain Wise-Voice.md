> "The Voice enlightens all."

For pride and wisdom, you lost your debate.
In ecstasy beyond measure, your true self is complete.
The waves of dharma, flooding, engulfing, overwhelming.
Your mindfulness is lost in the world of evil.

You question the sky, the earth, and Buddha ,
One wrong step and every step thereafter repeats.
Here the winner loses, the losers win. The risen falls, the fallen rises.
You know how to save the lost in evil's heartbeat.

May your body serve this land since
The teachings of golden form shrouds all beings in their deceit.
