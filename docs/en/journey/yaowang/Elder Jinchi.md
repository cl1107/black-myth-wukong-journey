After two months of peace, Tang Monk reined in his horse. He saw towers
and halls nestled deep in the fold of the mountains. At the gate of the
place, they saw that it was indeed a temple.

The master and his disciple exchanged greetings before passing through
the mountain gate. In the main hall, they saw the name of the place:
"Guanyin Temple". Tang Monk was overjoyed, but Monkey said, "Master,
this is no good place. Better to leave soon." But the monk wouldn't listen.
He knelt before every golden statue he saw in prayer, and the monkey,
impatient with his master's attitude, began to strike the bell incessantly,
startling all the monks in the temple. Those from the upper and lower
halls all poured out.

The monks greeted Tang Monk. Monkey used his See-through Eyes to
look around and laughed, "Why do you monks here look so sickly and
Weak, with your spirits drained? Have you broken the precepts?""
In Tang Monk's perception, the monks all wore brand-new kasayas and
had tall, sturdy bodies. He considered Monkey's words to be mere
nonsense and remarked, "Don't speak so recklessly." Then, he turned to
apologize to the monks. The monks themselves regarded Monkey's words
as nonsense as well. Only two small monks, hidden in the crowd, dared
not reveal themselves.

The Elder of the temple invited the master and disciple to the back
chamber for tea. After the monks had taken their seats and the feast was
laid out, the two small monks assisted the elderly monk inside.
Tang Monk bowed respectfully. The two exchanged a few pleasantries,
and Tang Monk inquired, "May I ask about your esteemed age, venerable
elder?" The old monk replied, "Despite my many mistakes, I have lived to
see my two hundred and seventieth year." When Monkey heard this, he
laughed and said, "Old skinflint! Why do I smell yaoguai in this temple?"
The old monk did not answer. Tang Monk hastened to interject, "This
disciple of mine can be somewhat unruly at times. Please, do not take
offense."

A small monk was just then using an exquisite vessel to pour three cups of
fragrant tea for them. Monkey stared at him and said, "Where are you
from, little monk?" The small monk set down the tea and swiftly hid
behind the old monk. Biting his finger, he said, "This one has a furry face
and a strange head. He's a bit scary."

Tang Monk glanced at Monkey and said, "Mind your words! Don't offend
people with your brashness!" He then shifted the conversation by praising
the tea and the vessels.

The old monk didn't seem to mind. Instead, he asked Tang Monk, "Noble
sir, hailing from the Emperor's capital, might you have any treasures that
you could lend me for a mere glimpse?"

Tang Monk declined repeatedly, but Monkey laughed and said, "Master,
isn't your kasaya itself a treasure? Why not allow him a glimpse?
All the monks laughed. Then they brought out twelve cases of kasayas,
unfurled them, and hung them up for Tang Monk to see. But Monkey
laughed and said, "Very well, very well. Put them away. Bring ours out for
a look too."

Tang Monk grabbed Monkey and tried hard to stop him, but Monkey said,
"Do not fret! Do not fret! I know what I'm doing!" Without more words,
he took out the kasaya for the monks to see.
As the old monk gazed upon such a wonder, his spirit was touched. He
walked up to Tang Monk and knelt with tears in his eyes. "This humble
monk is verily bereft of fortune. My eyes are dim and clouded. I cannot see
it clearly."

Monkey laughed again and said, "And how do you intend to inspect it
clearly?" The old monk replied,"If you would be so kind and trusting,
allow me to take it to the back chamber and study it carefully overnight. I
shall return it to you tomorrow morning before your departure. May I
know your thoughts on this?"

Upon hearing this, Tang Monk was startled and chided Monkey. Monkey
laughed and said, "What are you afraid of? Let him take it for a look. If
anything goes wrong, I'll handle it."
