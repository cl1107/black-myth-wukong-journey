# Kang-Jin Star

> Loong maiden, Kang-Jin fair, White horns by emerald sea.
> Ambition beyond mortal care, Grace unmatched, wild and free.
> Black and white entwine, Old friends hard to find.
> Under wind's blade and frost's cold blow, She dances still in swirling
> snow.

Despite Kang-Jin Loong's long wait, no constellation officer defended to
her aid.

Yellowbrow laughed, "You, young lady, your high opinion of yourself is
precisely why you've ended up like this, an utter loser."
Kang-Jin Loong replied, "As long as I haven't begged for mercy, winning
or losing is irrelevant."

Not antagonized, Yellowbrow said calmly, "You wouldn't take such a risk
just for that lookout cockerel. You must be curious about that monkey."

Kang-Jin Loong remained silent.

"1 do have something of that monkey's, right here in this sack." With that,
he untied a sack from his waist.

Kang-Jin Loong recognized it as the sack that had once captured them and
scoffed, "What's so special about it? It's not like I haven't been in it
before."

"Well.. If you really want to know about him, you'll have to see for
yourself." With that, Kang-Jin Loong was sucked into the sack.

As she entered the sack, she seemed to see a ten-tailed goldfish swimming
towards her.

Not long after, when Yellowbrow released her, the constellation officer
had become dazed and bewildered.

Seeing this, Yellowbrow laughed heartily, "Well, is he still the hero you
remember?"

Kang-Jin Loong asked, "Is he, along with all the gods and Buddhas in the
Celestial Realm, all like this?"

Yellowbrow neither confirmed nor denied it.

After a long while, Kang-Jin Loong suddenly knelt on the ground and
uttered, "Please, Master, accept me as your disciple..."
