# Yin-Yang Fish

> Black Yin fish, white Yang fish,
> Stirring storms with a sky-flipping swish.
> Leaping, twirling, never at rest,
> Boundless power in a bowl compressed.

In the South Sea, there is a fish over six meters long. Its dorsal fin
resembles a blade and can change color at will, whether white or black.
This fish can fly into the sky, creating massive winds and waves as tall as
mountains. Each time this fish appears, the village suffers from a plague.

Once, a fisherman returning from his catch encountered an elderly man
who could barely walk. Despite his frailty, the old man carried a heavy,
tattered bundle filled with scrolls. Exhausted and without money to pay
for a boat ride, he struggled along the riverbank. The kind-hearted
fisherman, seeing the old man's plight, offered him a free ride across the
river and even gave him two fresh fish for a meal. Grateful, the old man
performed a divination on the spot and said, "In a few days, a young man
wearing a bamboo hat and a white robe will pass by. Under no
circumstances should you let him come to your village. On the day he
arrives, do not conduct any business on the river, or you will lose your
life."

After delivering these cryptic words, the old man vanished from the boat,
leaving the fisherman both astonished and frightened. Yet, he etched the
old man's warning deep into his heart. A few days later, while fishing, he
indeed saw a man on the riverbank who matched the old man's

description exactly. The man, claiming to be weary from his travels, asked
the fisherman if he could take him to the nearby fishing village to rest. The
fisherman initially wanted to refuse but then decided to take the man to a
neighboring village downstream instead. After dropping the man off, the
fisherman docked his boat and dared not return to the river.

At that moment, the man pulled a black bowl from his sleeve and threw it
into the river. As soon as the bowl hit the water, a massive, pitch-black fish
emerged, and a fierce storm erupted, with waves surging sky-high. The
fisherman fled without looking back. Some time later, he heard that a
severe plague had struck the neighboring village, killing many people.
Initially feeling a sense of relief, he soon learned that refugees from the
neighboring village had brought the plague to his own village, and they
too were not spared.
