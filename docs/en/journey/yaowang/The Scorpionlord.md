The Mountain of Venom, neighboring the West Liang Kingdom of
Women, inherited its tradition of female supremacy.

The mountain was ruled by a Scorpion Queen, a Guai of Desire, renowned
for her enchanting beauty. She practiced the Dao of "Concentration",
excelling in bedroom arts and matters of pleasure, thus having countless
partners for her practice.

Among these partners was a male scorpion, adorned in golden armor and
claws, whose strong build earned him the queen's favor. Together, they
had a brood of scorpion offspring. However, none of the offspring were
female, which led her to lose interest in passing them her skills.
Consequently, the golden-armored male scorpion also fell out of favor.
Seeing that the queen no longer sought his company, the male scorpion,
with high self-esteem, took his children and moved outside the mountain,
severing ties with her.

Later, when the journeyers passed through the Kingdom of Women, the
Scorpion Queen, true to her nature as a Guai of Desire, kidnapped Tang
Monk, which cost her her life when Sun Wukong summoned the
Dawnstar, whose crow killed her instantly. Her maidens, the captives from
the Kingdom of Women, held in her cave, dispersed, taking all the
treasures with them. Still seething with anger, Sun Wukong set the place
ablaze, turning everything to ashes.

Sensing the fire, the male scorpion outside the mountain rushed to the
scene, only to find his former love stripped of her clothes, her tail severed,
and her body reduced to a bloody pulp, dead at the foot of the slope. After
much inquiry, he learned that it was the Dawnstar of Constellation Mao
that had killed her. With this knowledge, he vowed to avenge her.

Fortunately, the Guai of Desire had imparted some techniques to him. He
hence settled in the Pipa Cave, rebuilding her force and dedicating himself
to practice. . However, being male, he struggled to achieve great success,
leading to the decline of Mountain of Venom's reputation. Upon learning
that Webbed Hollow was the premier place for insect guais to practice, he
took his sons and sought refuge there.
