# Keeper of the Flaming Mountains

> The furnace crumbles, bricks fall, a day of disgrace,
> Lament did he, the beauty he could not embrace.
> All his talents wasted on the golden son,
> Looking back, he's become a foolish one.

The galaxy was clear, and the sky was spotless. That night, a young Daoist
boy sat by the furnace, fanning the fire. Feeling drowsy, he was about to
sneak in a nap when he suddenly heard a soft laugh.

Looking up, he saw his master standing at the door with a girl, watching
him doze off. He quickly straightened his clothes and stood up to
apologize. Contrary to his usual stern demeanor, the master did not scold
him. Instead, he called the boy over and briefly introduced the newcomer,
instructing them to guard the furnace together from now on. Finally, he
said lightly, "she is your senior. You may call her Rakshasi."

At first, the young Daoist boy was delighted to have a companion, but
upon hearing that the newcomer was a senior, he felt displeased. As soon
as the master left, he decided to make things difficult for her.

Handing her the fan, he said, "The furnace is now your responsibility. It's
only right that the older one does the work, isn't it, my senior?" The young
woman did not argue and simply smiled, "Indeed, my junior, you may go
rest."

The next day, when the master ascended the altar, the girl approached.
The young Daoist boy thought she was going to complain, but instead, she
said, "Master, as a new disciple, it is only right that I fan the fire. However,
the fan my junior gave me is a bit small and not very handy."

The master glanced at the young Daoist boy and smiled, "If that's the case,
I'll make a new one for you. You may as well wield it as a nice vessel."

The young Daoist boy had not expected his usually strict master to be so
kind to the girl. Gradually, he began to see her in a new light.

From then on, they practiced together. He discovered that the girl was
adept in both Buddhist and Daoist teachings. No matter what scripture the
master taught, she could always engage in discusssion, whereas he often
struggled to keep up, both in speech and thought.

Later, when the furnace was kicked over, he was severely punished by the
master. While other disciples looked on coldly, it was only this senior who
volunteered to descend to the mortal realm to help him.

 In the mortal realm, he learned that his senior had her own cave dwelling
and a group of loyal followers. The master had even granted her the title
of Earthy Immortal as compensation.

Some time later, the master arranged for her to marry a yaoguai king in the
mortal realm. Though he felt a bit melancholic, he understood that he was
ultimately unworthy of her, no matter how many dirty tasks he had done
for the master. In the master's eyes, he would never be a match for her.
