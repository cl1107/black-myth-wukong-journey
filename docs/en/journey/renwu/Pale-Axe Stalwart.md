"Splendid! That's the morale I want to see," the Bull King exclaimed,
seated in the main camp atop the cliff, observing the bull guais training
below.

Standing beside him, the Pale-Axe Stalwart reported, "My king, only such a
powerful army is worthy of your majestic presence."

The Bull King nodded approvingly, saying, "You've done well, young
captain."

Looking at the Pale-Axe Stalwart, he said kindly, "You've not been under
my command for long, yet you've managed to train this mixed troop so
well. It's beyond my expectations."

The Pale-Axe Stalwart replied humbly, "When I first arrived and saw how
well-regulated the King's domain was, I was equally surprised."

Realizing he might have misspoken, he quickly apologized, "I meant to
say..."

The Bull King laughed heartily, "No worries. The well-regulated domain is
all thanks to the Lady of the House. Her strict rules keep these boneheads
in line."

The Pale-Axe Stalwart also laughed, "Indeed, I was initially taken aback by
her strict rules."

Seeing his straightforwardness, the Bull King praised, "You've done well
in managing the troops. I'll promote you to be my vanguard."

The Pale-Axe Stalwart quickly knelt, "Thank you, my king, for the
promotion. I will serve you with utmost loyalty."

 Just then, a voice called out, "Father, why have you summoned me?""
The Pale-Axe Stalwart looked up to see a red-skinned youth approaching
from behind.

"I called you to observe how to muster and command troops. This is my
newly appointed vanguard; come and meet him."

The youth patted the Pale-Axe Stalwart on the shoulder and smiled, "Very
good. If my father trusts you, you must be capable. When I become king,
you shall be my general."

The Bull King clapped his hands and laughed, "Such ambition! The future
of this domain will depend on you."

The youth pondered for a moment and said,"Father, why not entrust that
item to me as well?"

The Bull King's face darkened, and he did not respond.

"Father, you trust me with the domain," the youth continued, "so why
not with a mere object? Ever since you obtained it, you've grown more
haggard. Mother is very worried."

The Bull King waved his hand dismissively, "Do not mention this again."
The youth, though puzzled, did not wish to defy his father and left
reluctantly.
