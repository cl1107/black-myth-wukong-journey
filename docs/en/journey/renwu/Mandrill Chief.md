# Mandrill Chief

> A heart caring with dreams unclear,
> She left the mountain, ventured far and near.
> Seeking the Five Skandhas, found naught,
> True wisdom lies in letting go, she's taught.

The "Tripitaka Scriptures" depict the Mandrill as possessing extraordinary
abilities, capable of grasping the sun and moon, shrinking mountains,
discerning fortunes, and manipulating the universe with its power.

In Mount Huaguo, a day unlike any other unfolded. The Mandrill Chief
was leaping through the mountains when she suddenly saw the celestial
stone on the mountaintop explode, producing a stone egg. As the wind
blew over it, the stone egg transformed into a stone monkey. The Mandrill
Chief approached to observe, and the stone monkey began to mimic,
learning to crawl and walk. Subsequently, the stone monkey bowed to the
four directions, and its eyes emitted two beams of golden light that shot
up to the Celestial Palace. Delighted, the Mandrill Chief brought the stone
monkey into the forest to meet the other monkeys. This extraordinary
stone monkey soon proved its worth and, after a series of contests, became
the king of the monkeys, earning the title "Handsome Monkey King."

For three to five hundred years, the Monkey King led the monkeys in
carefree joy. One day, he began to worry about life and death. The
Mandrill Chief advised the Monkey King to go out and seek the Dao. After
the Monkey King returned, he rewarded the Mandrill Chief by appointing
her as a general. Later, the Monkey King was titled the Great Sage, became
a celestial official, caused havoc in the Celestial Palace, was subdued and
imprisoned under a mountain, became a monk, achieved enlightenment,
and finally became a Buddha... After several rises and falls, he ultimately
returned to the mountain and transformed back into a stone.

One day, an immortal appeared in the dream to the Mandrill Chief, telling
her that all Five Skandhas are empty and can transcend all suffering. The
immortal explained that if she could visit all the sacred places and temples
in the world, gather the essence of the Five Skandhas, and make the Five
Skandhas Pill, she might be able to awaken the stone and restore its divine
spirit.

Thus, she traveled across the three realms and four lands, searching for
ingredients to make the pill, until she encountered a monkey that looked
exactly like the Monkey King...
