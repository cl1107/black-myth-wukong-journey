# The Third Prince

> In the Kingdom of Flowing Sands,
> His lineage held the throne,
> Chu-Bai Spear in hand,
> A prince of might well-known.

The Third Prince, renowned in the City of Pin, originally hailed from a
distant land before becoming a disciple of Bodhisattva Guoshiwang.
Bodhisattva Guoshiwang was famed for his ability to subdue yaoguais. This
was precisely the skill that the Third Prince sought to learn, as his
homeland was plagued by rampant yaoguais.

After the journeyers had bested the Yellow Wind Sage, the Third Prince
was relieved to learn that the sage had been sent back to Mount Lingshan.
This news allowed him to focus on his mountain practice undisturbed.
Later, whispers of another grand ceremony in the New West caught his
attention. With his master's permission, he set out with his four captains
to investigate, suspecting Yellowbrow of foul play. However, they were
met with a crushing defeat, as Yellowbrow had once again stolen his
master's Vessel.

"Master, we have suffered a resounding defeat. This is not the first
encounter we've had with him, and yet, here we stand, vanquished once
more."

"Master, a beguiling spell had taken me. I had to wound myself to stay
awake."

"Master, be warned: that old guai now possesses an immense gilded form,
which turns aside blades and spears with ease. Exercise utmost caution."

"Master, the four captains must have been bewildered by some evil spells.
Now, they have bowed before Yellowbrow and become his devotees."

"Master, my first captain debated with Yellowbrow and was deluded. Now
he sings beguiling chants in the dungeon to incite our surrender."

"Master, Yellowbrow twisted off my second captain's head. Into pus and
blood it turned. Yellowbrow's evil craft then transformed the blood and
 pus into a lotus flower blooming at the temple gate."

"Master, the third captain threw his weapon at Yellowbrow, and
Yellowbrow broke the captain's limbs and reattached them with those of
others."

"Master, the fourth captain was struck by Yellowbrow's Spikeshaft
Cudgel. His body was pierced, and eyes grew out of every hole."

"Master, it was my command that led the four captains to attack
Yellowbrow. I was wrong; it's all my fault, all my fault."

The Third Prince, driven mad, having blinded himself and deafened his
ears, muttered incessantly in the dungeon. Could his master truly hear his
words spoken to the walls? Did he even have a master? Why had his
master never come to save him?
