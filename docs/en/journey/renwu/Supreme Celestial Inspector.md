# Supreme Celestial Inspector

> The mighty Inspector, the emperor's guard so grand,
> Rides fiery wheels, at the celestial gate to stand.
> Upholding justice, silent and stern,
> With one steel whip, the souls burn.

 In the Celestial Court, it was a well-known fact among gods and Buddhas
that Taiyi Thunderclap Supreme, also known as the Supreme Inspector,
was the Jade Emperor's most loyal enforcer. If his gaze was fixed upon
someone, it spelled certain doom. Admiral Tianpeng, who was cast down
to become a pig, served as a prime example; once a prominent rising star,
he vanished without a trace after the Supreme Inspector reported him.

Initially, the Supreme Inspector did not have his current peculiar
appearance. Though not as handsome as Tianpeng, he was at least
presentable. Later, the Jade Emperor, in appreciation of the Inspector's
impartial enforcement of his decrees, transformed the Inspector's head
into the shape of his right hand, symbolizing that when the Inspector was
 present, it is as if the Jade Emperor himself was there.

When deities encountered the Inspector, they respectfully greeted him
and then quickly distanced themselves. They dared not engage in any
high-spirited discussions in his presence, fearing that any mistake might
be caught and reported.

Although the Inspector had no close companions, he did have some
interactions with an old god of very high rank in the Celestial Court, aside
from the Jade Emperor.

Some immortals said that since the Inspector willingly took on such a
significant role, he deserved to endure this solitude; every advantage came
with a disadvantage. Others argued that the Inspector accepted this
unappealing position precisely because he preferred not to socialize,
finding himself perfectly at ease and content in his role. Opinions were
divided, and no consensus was reached. As for what the Inspector truly
thought, no one knew.
