# Bodhisattva Lingji

> From emptiness, desires arise, bringing strife,
> From compassion, lust grows, vast as life.
> Past joys turn to future regrets,
> Cleanse the heart, let go, as the wind sets.

The reasons behind Bodhisattva Lingji's beheading were widely debated.

Tiger Vanguard put it this way: "How could we, mere followers, dare to
discuss the master's affairs? However, I once heard my father mention that
our master despised that Bodhisattva of some sort. Their so-called
'master-disciple bond'. Huh, to me, it was more about merely seeking
protection. Being a yaoguai, you got to be pragmatic. Immortals and
Buddhas don't show mercy; it's all about mutual benefit."

The King of Flowing Sand seemed to know more details: "Years ago, when
Master helped my humble kingdom avert disasters, I caught a glimpse of
that big beetle. It had a Buddha head on its back, identical to the one
Master beheaded. Alas, everyone in my kingdom turned into rats later.
Master said it was a calamity he brought upon us and left with his
followers. I know he didn't want to leave; he always wanted yaoguais to
live dignified lives..."

The Second Prince was terse: "Master? Not bad. The Bodhisattva?
Deserved it."

Ma Tianba, passing through, sighed and said: "An oil-stealing rat climbs
high only if someone sets up a ladder."

The Yellow Wind Sage had only one comment about the matter: "Those
who bring disaster upon others will have disaster brought upon
themselves. If not by me, then by someone else."
