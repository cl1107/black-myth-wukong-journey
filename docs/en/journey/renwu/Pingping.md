# Pingping

> Born to a fate of trials and woes,
> Who pities the ebb and flow of those?
> Better to live in nature's embrace,
> Freely to wander, freely to repose.

After delivering her homework to her mother, Pingping went to the
Height of Ember. Her brother had asked her to meet him there, saying he
had something important to discuss.

When she arrived, she saw Red Boy standing with his hands on his hips,
directing Quick as Fire and Fast as Wind to burn the bull guais to flee as his
way of training them. Amused at the scene, he laughed loudly and
boisterously.

"Brother," Pingping called softly. Ever since Red Boy returned from
Guanyin's tutelage, she felt he had changed. Every time she spoke to him,
a subtle fear tugged at her heart.

Upon seeing her arrival, Red Boy waved to halt the training and turned to
her, "Pingping, let's engage in a game," he proposed,"You will run, and I
shall chase you. Let us see if I can catch you before an incense stick burns
out."

In the past, Pingping would transform into a little fox, leaping through
rocks and crevices, always having the upper hand. Yet this time, Red Boy
shattered her hiding rocks with a single spear thrust, scorched her
standing deadwood with a breath of fire, and flew over the cliffs she
jumped across as a red cloud.

 In less than half the time it takes for an incense stick to burn, Red Boy
 effortlessly caught her and sighed, "Mother's teachings are still too
gentle."

Seeing his sister's gloomy face, Red Boy took her to rest by the cliff in the
Furnace Valley. To cheer her up, he twirled his Firepoint for her
entertainment.

Seeing his little sister clapping and cheering, Red Boy asked, "How do you
think my skills compare to Father's?"

Pingping couldn't answer. She had never dared to make such a
comparison. She took out the Fire Dates her mother had rewarded her and
shared them with Red Boy, changing the subject to talk about anecdotes in
the mountains. Seeing this, Red Boy didn't press further and responded
perfunctorily.

Pingping cautiously said, "Brother, you and I have always been the closest.
If you have something on your mind, you can tell me. It's not easy for our
family to be reunited. I just want to live peacefully in these mountains,
away from worldly strife."

Gazing at the burning clouds, Red Boy said, "Sister, you should see more of
the outside world. There's no such thing as living away from worldly
strife. It's just self-deception of losers!"

Pingping wanted to ask him who he was competing with and why he had
to compete. But before she could speak, she felt a blow to the back of her
neck and fainted.
