In the highest sky, above the Jade Pool.

Amidst the swirling clouds and mist, celestial maidens flitted to and fro.
Today, the Queen Mother of the West was hosting a lotus-viewing
banquet.

As Admiral Tianpeng walked past the gate, he saw a tall, burly man blocked
by a celestial maiden. "Admiral Curtainraiser," the maiden said in a polite
but cold manner, "without a handwritten invitation from the Queen
Mother, you cannot sit by the pool. If you don't mind, why not take a seat
in the side hall and have some tea." The burly man responded in
obedience, but his gaze fixed in the main hall.

At such behavior, Tianpeng subtly shook his head, a faint smile playing on
his lips. He presented his invitation to the other maiden at the gate and
strode in, his head held high.

The banquet was in full swing, with celestial officials exchanging toasts,
their joyful laughter resonating throughout the hall, creating an
atmosphere of mirth and merriment.

Tianpeng, an admiral who guarded the celestial river, seldom attended
such festive gatherings. However, he managed to greet everyone as if he
was well-acquainted with them all, all while mindful not to overindulge in
wine.

The God of Longevity stood beside the Queen Mother, stroking his beard
and chuckled, "Such extravagance. I wonder how would the Peach
Banquet surpass it."

A constellation officer, standing nearby, chuckled at the Elder's concern,
"Elder, such worries are in vain. With the allure of those nine-thousand-
year peaches, even a casual arrangement of tables outside the Celestial
Gate would draw the dignitaries from across the three realms, be they
 noble or humble, eager to partake in a taste."

A red-faced immortal sneered, "It's not the peaches they seek, but rather
to bow before the Jade Emperor and the Three Supremes, and worship the
Buddhas of the west. Such assemblies are scarce pretexts for them to curry
favor and bask in the company of the divine."

The Queen Mother spoke with solemn dignity, "The Peach Banquet is no
trivial matter. Our gathering today is but a prelude, a rehearsal of the rites
and rituals that must be executed with exactness and reverence."

Upon concluding her speech, the Queen Mother signaled to the Lord of
Luna with a glance. With a few claps of his hands, a group of maidens
dressed in white entered the hall.

The maidens took their positions by the Jade Pool and began to play
instruments, sing, and dance. Among them, one dancer, with hair like
silver, and a dress like clouds, stood out with her exceptional grace.
Tianpeng had never seen the beautiful celestial maidens so closely, and he
was fascinated.

A celestial maiden in a violet gauze dress, holding an exquisite cup of wine
with both of her hands. "Admiral," she softly called.

Drenched in his fascination, Tianpeng took the cup from her hands, yet his
gaze never left the white dancing sleeves.

After the dance concluded, Tianpeng regained senses. He rose up to toast
the Queen Mother, yet the queue was long; by the time he reached the
end of it, he found himself already outside the gate.

Suddenly, he heard someone shouting, "Shoes! His shoes!"

He looked over and saw two celestial officers supporting a drunken
monkey as they hurried past.

Tianpeng thought to himself, When will I ever get to be as drunk as that
monkey?
