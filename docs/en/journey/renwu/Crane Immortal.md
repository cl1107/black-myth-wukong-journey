# Crane Immortal

> In crimson-embroidered crown, pure and refined,
> Ascending to meet the immortal, unconfined.
> Revered in the vast skies, far and wide,
> What foolish man would dare not abide?

The newly appointed Dawnstar originally served in the Hall of Incense.
Now promoted, he had his first opportunity to tour the Celestial Palace.

As he exited the Celestial Palace, he was met by the Crane Immortal, who
first took him to the Celestial Gate to be introduced to the Captains of the
Court on duty and the Four Heavenly Kings. They then visited the Thirty-
Three Halls and the Seventy- Two Palaces, paying respects to everyone
along the way.

The celestial beings treated them with utmost courtesy, which greatly
pleased the newly appointed Constellation Officer. After the tour, the
Crane Immortal was about to personally escort the Dawnstar back to the
Palace of Illumination.

On the way back, the Dawnstar suddenly asked, "I wonder if my
predecessor was promoted or demoted. Could you enlighten me, so I may
know how to conduct myself in the future?"

The Crane Immortal smiled and said, "He mingled too closely with the
mortal realm, perhaps making some friends among the mountains and
wilds. Now, having shed his celestial bonds, who can say where he revels
in his newfound freedom?"

The Constellation Officer frowned and asked, "1 heard that the Dome of
Stars conducts roll calls daily. How could it be that the Constellation
Officer left without anyone knowing?"

The Crane Immortal gently smoothed the wrinkles on the Dawnstar's robe
and said somberly, "If he hadn't left quietly, how would you be here
now?"

Hearing this, the Dawnstar seemed to understand and did not pursue the
matter further.
