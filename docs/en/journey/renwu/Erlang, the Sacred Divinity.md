# Erlang, the Sacred Divinity

> In skies high, his talents shine, like plum blooms pure and bright,
> His form defies the winter's snow, a sacred being of light.
> With lofty heart, he claims no kin to the emperor above,
> His noble spirit dims the stars, unlocking the Great Pagoda.

"These are just monkeys, none of them has anything worthwhile."

A celestial soldier used his spear to flip over a corpse, complaining to his
fellow. Before them lay the aftermath of the battle at Mount Huaguo:
 jagged rocks, ancient trees charred by lightning, and bodies strewn across
the landscape.

"The good stuff is all in the Water Curtain Cave. We only get to clean up
the battlefield," replied the fellow.

"True. We just do the dirty work, finishing off those who aren't quite dead
yet." With that, the celestial soldier thrust his spear into a corpse and
pulled it out again.

They methodically checked each body until they reached a large boulder.
The celestial soldier knocked on the stone. Watching this, his fellow said,
"It's just a rock. What do you expect to find out of it?"

The celestial soldier replied, "Don't you know? This is Sun Wukong."

The fellow looked puzzled. "Nonsense, how could this be Sun Wukong?"

"He died earlier, with his six roots severed and given to the yaoguai kings.
 Born from a stone, and now with his senses gone, he naturally turned back
into stone after death."

"Bollocks," said his fellow.

"You don't believe it?" The celestial soldier boasted, "I was at the front of
the formation and saw it clearly. When they dismembered his body, even
the Sacred Divinity took a piece."

The fellow, curious, asked, "I don't remember you being at the front... Is
that true? Even the Sacred Divinity tooka piece? I saw all those yaoguai
kings from the lower realms today. I thought only yaoguais would take
things from other yaoguais."

"He's not just any yaoguai; he was once granted Buddhahood," corrected
the celestial soldier.

"Why would the Sacred Divinity take that? Isn't it considered bad luck?"

"Who knows? Sun Wukong was powerful. Maybe consuming it would be
highly beneficial." They both laughed heartily.

"Hey, look at this," said the fellow, noticing something white beside the
stone.

They picked it up and found it was a branch of plum blossoms, as white as
jade, as pure as snow, blooming fragrantly.

The celestial soldier wondered, "How could there be plum blossoms on
Mount Huaguo?"

The fellow said, "This looks somewhat like..."

Before he could finish, a spearhead pierced through his chest, emitting a
golden light that even dispersed the soul within his armor.

The celestial soldier looked over his fallen fellow's shoulder, shocked.
Before he could react, the golden light flashed again.

White clouds drifted past, leaving the mountain peak in tranquility once
more.
