Gray and white, ice and snow blanketed the entire mountain range.
In a deep valley, there was a peculiar cave with a lush green watermelon
field, thriving exceptionally well. A young monk was in the field, picking
melons, patting them here and there, but none seemed to satisfy him.

Next to the watermelon field stood a strange man wearing a bamboo hat,
watching the young monk pick watermelons. "My brother said that if
there's a chance, I can test the monkey on his behalf," he said,

The young monk finally picked up a watermelon, weighed it in his hands,
and smiled, "This one is good, ripe and sweet. The one you mentioned,
 I've already checked him for you, he's good."

The strange man replied, "If I don't test him myself, I won't be at ease to
tell my brother about him."

The young monk exerted his strength and split the watermelon in half,
"Instead of feeling unease about him, I worry more about your brother."

The strange man pondered for a moment and said, "The thing is guarded
by my brother. There is nothing to worry about."

The young monk, munching on both halves of the watermelon, said
noncommittally, "That thing tests the bearer's heart greatly. He has borne
it alone for many years, let's hope he doesn't fail at the last moment."

The strange man quickly responded, "That's why, if this time that monkey
succeeds, wouldn't it be the best of both of you?"

The young monk stopped, looked up at the strange man, who quickly
bowed his head and apologized.

The young monk laughed again, waved his hand, and said, "Go, go. First,
pass my disciple's test, then we'll talk about the rest."
