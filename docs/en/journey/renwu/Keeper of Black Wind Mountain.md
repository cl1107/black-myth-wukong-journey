# Keeper of Black Wind Mountain

> A kind face veils his virtuous light,
> The benevolent eyes mask his might.
> To the one he grants a wondrous spell
> For that the story has yet to tell.

 As stated in the Celestial Laws, a Keeper has the duty to observe the living
beings in his domain and nurture the soil and streams.

That day, as the Keeper of the Black Wind Mountain made his customary
rounds on the hills, tending to mortal concerns, he saw an aged Daoist
drawing near from a distance: a vestment embellished with stars, a herb-
gathering basket plaited from verdant creepers, a fishing drum tapped in
his hand, and a song about the lofty moon. In just a few steps, he glided his
way to the Keeper.

The Keeper looked closely and was sure they had never met. But judging
from the Daoist's white hair, vibrating face, and bright eyes full of
authority, the Keeper knew he was no ordinary mortal. Hastily, he greeted
the Daoist, "Daoist master, this humble Keeper pays his respects."

The old Daoist nodded slightly and passed his basket to the Keeper. 
The Keeper took a look and saw that the basket was filled with rare and
mystical items, as well as miraculous herbs. He couldn't help but be
startled and asked, "How can a humble Keeper accept such a generous
gift?".

The Daoist smiled and said, "I was just passing through this place, but I
knew that soon, there would be a great upheaval in this mountain. I
thought the items in this basket would help you weather the storm for a
while, so I came to visit."

"What made you say this, sir?"

"1 have an old acquaintance with a bad temper. Although he has amassed a
measure of merit, I worry that with his arrogant nature, he shall find it
impossible to stay out of trouble. I fear he will bring great disaster upon
himself again...".

The Keeper thought carefully and said sincerely, "What can a humble
Keeper be of help?""
Seeing that the Keeper was quite astute, the old Daoist gestured for him to
draw near. He leaned in and murmured something into the Keeper's ear,
then instructed, "If you chance upon him in the mountain, pass on these
two spells. I cannot reveal myself, hence I rely on you to teach him, as a
means of honoring our bond."

The Keeper was immensely grateful and bowed deeply in appreciation.
The old Daoist returned the bow and was about to leave on a cloud. The
Keeper hurriedly asked, "May I inquire, Daoist master, from whence do
you hail?".

By the time the Keeper spoke, the Daoist had already vanished into the
distance. Aleaf floated down from the sky, its scent faint yet distinct, its
tip extremely slender and long: a bodhi leaf. At that moment, a revelation
dawned upon the Keeper. He bowed and paid his respects to the departing
silhouette until the clouds and mist obscured his sight, then turned to
depart.
