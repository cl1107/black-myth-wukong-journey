> Impulsive nature, a straightforward heart.

Gentle mountain breeze, wildflowers-covered ground, inside the stone
cave behind the temple.

The purple-faced Daoist Master asked with a gentle smile, "How long have
you been in this temple?"

"I... I do not know. I can only remember that the thunder has struck the
 hall over a hundred times," replied the Venom Daoist, standing cautiously
beside the master.

"Then it has been over a hundred years," the master said, walking towards
the bare stone wall, about to touch it.

"Master," the Daoist called out,"I have been here for a long time, yet you
have not taught me any skills. Could you perhaps teach me a few moves
today?"

"You wish to learn my skills?"

"Since the day I called you 'Master', yes."

"Your foundation is solid, and energy channels harmonized. Your have
already achieved high. I am afraid learning my skills won't help you
much."

The Daoist tensed up at the master's words, fully on guard.

Yet, out of his expectation, the master uttered, "skills, I can offer no more,
but some unique methods of practices, I can offer. Yet they are beyond the
minds feeble, and demand strong willpower to succeed. If you are not
deterred by hardship, I can let you try."

 Intrigued, the Daoist asked, "What kind of unique methods?"

The Daoist shook his head and said, "Without your willingness to learn, I
cannot tell you that."

The Daoist pondered deeply, unable to make a decision.

The Daoist gently persuaded, "It is a path trodden by many of my disciples.
If you come here, attempt nothing, and achieve nothing, would it not be a
journey in vain?".

Hearing this, the Daoist remembered his brother's instructions and
inquired, "What can this method achieve?"

"It will refine your body, elevate your divine skills, and the path to
ascension shall be an ease!"

"Is it truly so profound?"

"If you find it not helping, you can stop at any time," the master said
confidently.

Moved by these words, the Daoist agreed immediately, "I am ready to
follow your instructions, Master."

"Come with me," the Daoist said, glancing once more at the stone wall
before leading the Daoist away.
