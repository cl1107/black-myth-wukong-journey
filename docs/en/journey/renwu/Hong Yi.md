# Hong Yi

> Tearful eyes reflect tearful eyes,
> Broken hearts echo broken cries.
> The world harbors the cold and sly,
> Yet spares this soul in serpent's guise.

The Jade Emperor sat on his throne in the Celestial Palace, gathering the
officials.

Hong Yi stood among the immortals and saw Taibai Jinxing leading in an
officer in. A crown of Five Peaks on his head, a Landscape Engraved Tablet
in his hand, he wore the light of the seven stars on his robe, and walked to
the pleasant music of eight jade rings dangling from his waist.

Taibai Jinxing then announced, "Your Majesty, I have brought the son of
Bodhisattva Pilanpo from the Purple Cloud Mountain as commanded."

The Jade Emperor responded, "Let the celestial official come forward. I
appoint you as the 'Dawnstar', ranking among the Twenty-Eight
Constellations, and grant you residence in the Palace of Illumination.
Remember to be diligent in your duties and conduct your patrols on
time." The newly appointed Dawnstar thanked the Emperor for his grace.
The Jade Emperor then ordered the Crane Immortal and the Supreme
Celestial Inspector to escort him to his post, also bestowing upon him two
bottles of imperial wine and ten golden flowers.

The immortals congratulated the Dawnstar, while Hong Yi stood quietly
on the periphery, observing for a moment.

She was slightly older than him, and having grown up together due to the
deep connections and frequent interactions between their families, she
had always seen him as a younger brother. Now, witnessing his moment of
glory, she believed his future held limitless potential.

After waiting a while longer, she watched him greet and bid farewell to
others in front of the hall, his spirits high, yet he never glanced her way.
With a quiet sigh, she turned and slowly walked out of the hall.
