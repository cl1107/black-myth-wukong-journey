A scroll lay spread out on the desk, surrounded by four figures: a skinny
monkey, a mangy dog, an old loong, and a fierce tiger.
The old loong asked, "The Sacred Divinity sent us such a treasure. Do you
know his intent?"

The skinny monkey laughed strangely, "1 don't know. Maybe it's meant to
be hung up for decoration. If you don't want it, I'll trade it for wine."

The mangy dog, holding a palm fan, paced around the desk twice and said,
"We were banished to the mortal realm because of the Great Sage's affair.
Undoubtedly, it must be related to this. However, he..." His voice trailed
off, unsure how to proceed.

The fierce tiger, frustrated by the dog's hesitation, asked, "Do you mean to
say, is he here to help or to harm?"

The mangy dog fanned himself and retorted, "Such profound matters
cannot be spoken of so crudely."

The old loong asked, "What's on your minds?"

The skinny monkey lounged in his seat and said, "Not to help, not to help.
I'm just a drunkard. What good can I do but earn some wine money? The
rest is none of my concern." With that, he closed his eyes and pretended
to sleep, saying no more.

The fierce tiger chuckled and added, "I only know how to smith. If
someone comes seeking my help, I assist them, and that's all."

The mangy dog, growing anxious, exclaimed, "Why are you all cowering
in fear? We used to act justly. Look at us now, as if things could possibly
get any worse. I will lend my aid, I will lend my aid!

The old loong quickly intervened, "Brother, patience. We understand
your intentions. We need a plan, so if the Sacred Divinity reprimand us,
We have a response."

He paused, and the other three nodded in agreement. He continued,
"Since we are of the same plan, let's proceed accordingly. Each of us
should prepare and set off on an appointed day."
