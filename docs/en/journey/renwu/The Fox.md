# The Fox

> A fox beside the mountain stands, in sorrow deep and long,
> With caring heart and hopeful wish, for her savior to belong.
> With steadfast heart, it seeks the path, to rise and journey far,
> Yet fate unknown, her end draws near, before it sees the star.

According to ancient texts, a fox that lives for a hundred years can
transform into a human and gain knowledge of happening a thousand
miles away. After a thousand years, it can communicate with the ones
above and become a fox immortal.

There was once a young fox who harbored a deep aspiration to become a
fox immortal from a very young age. Driven by this dream, it practiced
diligently and tirelessly, never allowing itself to rest. In its quest for
knowledge, the young fox frequently sought advice from its kin, asking,
"How can I become a fox immortal?" Some experienced fox guais
responded with cautionary wisdom, saying, "Becoming a fox immortal is
no easy feat. Each year, the Lady of Mount Tai holds a rigorous
examination. Only those who demonstrate exceptional skill in both arts
and philosophy can ascend to immortality. Those who fail the examination
are destined to remain as ordinary wild foxes, forever barred from
achieving immortality."

The young fox asked, "But how can I excel in arts and philosophy? I don't
even have anything to write with."

The fox guai replied, "Once you can transform, you can take the form of a
beautiful woman or a handsome man and go to human towns to study and
learn. But remember this: the Lady of Mount Tai oversees all foxes and
despises those who seduce and consume humans. You must know that
absorbing human essence is the quickest way for yaoguais to become
powerful. If you wish to become a fox immortal, this path is forbidden, and
you must set off on much more perilous and arduous path."
The young fox said, "I understand now, but I am not afraid of the perils
and ordeals. I will discipline myself and follow the path to true
immortality."

From then on, the young fox relied solely on the essence of the sun and
moon for cultivation. Decades passed in the mountains. As she gradually
accquired the ability to transform, she often approached human villages to
observe their way of life. One day, it accidentally stepped into a hunter's
trap and was rescued by a young scholar who took it home...
