At the eastern end of Qingxu Alley stood a modest Daoist temple, home to
a solitary Daoist. This Daoist professed to have discovered the ancient
formula for an immortality pill from the sea, earning him a reputation as a
miraculous healer.

The Daoist's pills, when taken by the sick, showed no significant
improvement, and when taken by the healthy, had no noticeable effect. If
anyone inquired about their efficacy, he would calmly explain,"There is
no such thing as a wondrous cure-all pill that can bring the dead back to
life. True health arises from the harmony and smooth flow of one's
essence, vigor, and spirit." Consequently, people began to doubt the
 Daoist's skills, leading to his temple being sparsely visited and few seeking
 his medical assistance.

In the city, there was an old man named Mr. Chen, whose wealth rivaled
that of nobility. Now in his sixties, he had fallen gravely ill, showing signs
of being near the end of his life. His son sought out the Daoist and invited
him to treat his ailing father.

The Daoist had a yellow dog that he kept by his side at all times. This time,
he brought it along to the Chen residence. The Daoist prepared many
special pills for Mr. Chen. Although the household servants thought he
Was merely going through the motions, they dared not say much and
watched from the sidelines.

Unexpectedly, after taking the pills, Mr. Chen gradually began to eat and
drink a little, and his breathing became smoother, showing signs of
recovery. Yet, just when everything was getting better, in one of the
Daoist's pill-making sessions, his furnace exploded, killing him in the
process.

The household servants came to clean up the Daoist temporary quarters,
lamenting the whims of fate. To their astonishment, they saw the Daoist's
yellow dog, dressed in his clothes, walking out of the room. The dog was
fanning itself with a tattered palm-leaf fan and said, "1 had planned to
learn some mortal skills in the human world. Who would have thought
that in this world, great talent brings such peril!"

With that, the dog snapped the fan, and disappeared.
