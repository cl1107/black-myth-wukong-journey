# Maitreya

> The board is earth, the pieces sky,
> Colors of Yin and Yang comply.
> In subtle moves, revolutions blend,
> Laughing, praise the game that will never end.

Maitreya had been in the Great Pagoda for an unknown length of time.

When the Sacred Divinity arrived, the mural was still unfinished.

"1 knew you would come," Maitreya said with a smile.

The Sacred Divinity cupped his hands in salute, "Your wisdom is
unparalleled, Venerable One. You must have foreseen this day back on
Mount Huaguo. Therefore, I beseech you, please, relieve me of my inner
turmoil."

"Since your turmoil stem from Sun Wukong, he should be the one to
answer them."

"He is dead," the Sacred Divinity said, his voice faltering as if unwilling to
utter the word.

"I have already opened the path for you. No one will disturb you there.
Take your time to ponder," Maitreya said, stepping aside. Instantly, wind
and snow swirled in from the opposite wall, casting a chill throughout the
pagoda.

The Sacred Divinity stepped forward as instructed, stopping at the edge of
the void. He turned back and said, "By stepping into this painted Mount
Mei today, the Celestial Court will not be able to find me. Venerable One,
Would Mount Lingshan know of your deeds?"

Maitreya laughed, "Have we met before? The Erlang Shen I know is much
uglier than you.."

Hearing this, the Sacred Divinity said no more and strode into the wind
and snow.
