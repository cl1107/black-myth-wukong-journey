# Headless Monk

> Sanxian, sanxian, grief and rage untold,
> Defeated and demeaned by my follower bold.
> Confused, I saw kindness repaid with hate,
> The sands obscure the truth, the wind seals my fate.

 In the days when strange winds first howled through Windrest, a curious
event unfolded.

Children of the village were at play near the village's edge, when haunting
chords from the Sanxian wafted through the air. Their young ears caught
the song's pleasant notes: "In a land o' bloodshed and chaos's sting.."
Intrigued and never having heard such a song, the youngsters raced
toward the musician. As they neared, they beheld a figure leaning on a
boulder-headless.

The children scattered in fright, all but young Chengda, who stumbled
and fell. As he lay, weeping and watching his friends flee, the Headless
Monk ceased his strumming. He emerged from behind the rock and
strummed once more. Invisible forces gently lifted Chengda, steadying
him on his feet. No longer fearful, the boy observed that, apart from the
missing head, this figure resembled the benevolent monks he'd seen in the
hamlet.

Seeing Chengda unafraid, the Headless Monk plucked another chord. A
cooling breeze passed over the boy's bruised leg. Looking down, Chengda
found his wound miraculously healed. Clapping in joy, he exclaimed,
"Magic! Magic!" The monk strummed again, and Chengda's torn trousers
restored themselves. With that, the monk returned to his eerie song:
"Yellow Wind Ridge, a mighty ole' range, once buzzin' with joy and
glee..."' and vanished into a gust of wind and sand.

When the villagers returned to save Chengda, they found him pointing at
the sand, exclaiming, "It was an immortal" The adults scoffed, "Nonsense,
what sort of immortal lacks a head? You've seen a ghost, boy!"
