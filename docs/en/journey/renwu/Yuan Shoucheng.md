> Half a life in vain, half a life in haste,
> One dawn of clarity, one dawn erased.

Prophecies lag behind the schemes of man,
No augury can stay an obsessed hand.

Waves upon waves, the world's perils lie,
 Dust upon dust, uncountable debts beneath the sky.

Gatherings and partings like morning dew,
Grudges and loves like lightning, passing through.

A thousand years of rise and fall, nothing new,
A century's success and failure, something true.

Harvesting deeds, by the destiny's decree,
Fates rise and fall, as sunsets flee.

Harsh words spoken, ears they defy,
Careless talk, hearts they pry.

Crude strokes mar the eye's delight,
 Intent to sketch, wounds for sight.

Yaoguais and Buddhas, all in me,
Fiends and gods, alike we see.

My tears flow like springs, don't ask why,
Laughing to the sky, it's folly's cry.
