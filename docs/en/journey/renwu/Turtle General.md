# Turtle General

> Completing Xuanwu's name, the turtle and the snake,
> Cycles end and cycles start, the yaoguais they break.
> In frozen realms of ice and snow, they honor nature's call,
> United hearts in decay, better to die than living in pain.

The New West, above the Bitter Lake.

The Turtle and Snake Generals revealed their true forms. The Turtle
General, as massive as Mount Tai, landed in the sea, causing huge waves.
The Snake General, resembling the mythical Zhu Loong, coiled around a
mountain ridge, shaking the earth.

Yellowbrow showed no fear, wielding a Spikeshaft Cudgel, strong and
flexible, engaging the two generals in fierce combat. The Turtle sprayed
water, and the Snake breathed fire, almost gaining the upper hand.

Suddenly, Yellowbrow threw an object into the Bitter Lake, which
transformed into a ten-tailed golden fish. The fish grew rapidly upon
contact with water, entangling the Turtle General.

The Snake General intended to assist, but Yellowbrow untied a sack from
his waist, releasing a strange beast. This creature had a gilded body and a
Buddha's head, with sharp claws on its feet. On the shore, it engaged in a
fierce and evenly matched battle with the Snake General.

As the four clashed and shouted, Yellowbrow stood on the cliff, chanting.
Suddenly, a freezing wind howled, and a heavy snowstorm descended,
blanketing thousands of miles and freezing the lake's surface. Despite their
immortality, the Turtle and Snake were bound by their natural instincts to
hibernate in the cold. Gradually, they grew weary and exhausted, their
eyelids heavy with fatigue. After countless rounds, the Turtle General,
unable to endure any longer, sank into the icy depths of the water.

As he closed his eyes, the last scene he saw was the Snake General, unable
to escape the frost and icy blades, being cut into several chunks on the
shore...
