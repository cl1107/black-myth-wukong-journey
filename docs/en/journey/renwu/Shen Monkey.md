In Chang'an city stood the Temple of the Wild Goose Pagoda. Not far from
its gates lived a diligent temple-goer named Hao Desheng.

One day, Desheng dozed off as he sat at ease at home. In his dream, he
found himself at the temple gate. Four figures approached: a monkey, a
dog, a loong, and a tiger, all deep in talk. He heard the tiger ask, "Where
do you plan to take that thing?"

The loong shook his head. "Fret not. I hear they've all returned to their
caves. We need but make our way to each place and wait. Our meeting is
sure."

The dog then inquired, "May I ask, friends, where are you all off to?"
The monkey replied, "I'm not fond of the sun, rain, or chill wind. For
drinking, I shall seek out a lush and lovely spot."

The loong stretched his neck. "I need to dwell by the water. If your place
has a water view, we might dwell near."

The monkey waved him off. "I've seen that ugly mug of yours for all my
long years. Better we live far and distant from each other."

The loong paid him no heed and asked the dog, "And you, young one?
What plans do you have? Perhaps we can..."

The dog said, "No, no, the time isn't ripe. It's still too early. I'd rather head
to the mortal world, and have myself some experiences first."

"Hah, experiences!" scoffed the tiger. "You just yearn the hunt for rare
herbs to play with your furnace."

The dog flushed, but before he could retort, the monkey turned to the
tiger."And you? What's your plan?"

The tiger thumped his chest. "I'll guard the village."

Seeing his friends had made their choices, the old loong said, "Well then,
we don't need to travel together. Here's where we part ways, each to seek
our path. When I meet that one, I'll gather you all again."

With that, the four parted. Desheng heard a thunderclap and woke with a
start. The dream had already faded from his mind.
