## Wolf Scout

> Immaculate skills, the wolf's lone aim,
> No price too high, his heart aflame.
> Yet wayward efforts brought no gain,
> A futile vision-all in vain.

Among the wolf guais, there was a young one, ambitious and always seeking
rapid progress on the path of Dao. However, his time spent practicing was
short, and his skills remained shallow. He couldn't yet grasp the deeper
techniques of his clan, leaving him impatient.

One day, during his routine patrol, he carried a cask of fine wine. As he
passed the mountain gate, he encountered the gatekeeper, Bullguard, who
had a weakness for liquor. Eager to learn, the young wolf shared the wine
with Bullguard and seized the opportunity to inquire about secret
techniques. Partaken in the wine, feeling compelled, Bullguard taught him a
few tricks. Rejoicing, the young wolf hurried home to practice.

Two months passed, and having found little benefit in those teachings, he
contemplated giving up. Recalling his previous success in bartering wine for
knowledge, he retrieved a small golden statue and approached the Snake
Patroller. Persuaded by gold, the greedy creature shared some techniques
with him. Back at home, the young wolf practiced as instructed. Another
month passed, yet his gains remained minimal. Undeterred, he repeated his
tactics with other guais, exchanging valuables for teachings.

Over time, he visited everyone in the mountain, amassing a repertoire of
techniques. Yet, despite practicing one today and another the next, he made
no progress. Eventually, a compassionate elder wolf offered guidance. Yet,
the young wolf conversely started lecturing the kind old wolf with his
strange mastery, leaving him speechless. From that point on, no one in the
clan was willing to teach him.

## Wolf Swornsword

> Meager of wit wrapped in white attire,
> In sludge they crawl, yet yearn for higher.
> Bent to power, king's favor they seek,
> Where even lowly fowls may peak.

A white-robed wolf guai, patrolling the hills, seized a sword from a
traveler. Jewels studded its scabbard, its blade sharp and bright. Coveting
it, he strapped the sword to his side, revelling in its splendor. Yet, when it
was time to give tribute, he hid it away. The other guais chided, "Without
offering such treasures to the king, how will you earn his favor, or do you
fancy patrolling forever?" The wolf guai scoffed, "Such treasures we
cherish, the king barely notices. You offer scrap metal and dream of favor?
You are fools."

They dismissed his words, seeing them as mere excuses to shirk his duty,
while they toiled on. The wolf guai indulged in peaches and drank
wherever he could lay hands on them, keeping the very best for himself.
The others knew his punishment would come, and waited.

One day, the Black Wind King held a lecture on Buddhism in the
mountains, speaking of enlightenment and revival. His guardians spread
paper talismans, and all were commanded to consume them before the
chanting and prayers. Hours later, the king inquired about their
enlightenment. A pause fell; then, the white-robed wolf guai stood, and
there emerged others, one by one.

The next day, a decree was issued to the guardians: the wolf guai was
promoted to a minor captain. All the other guais, puzzled, whispered
among themselves. How had the wolf guai not only escaped punishment
but found himself rewarded?

## Wolf Soldier

> Sunswept hills they guard and tread,
> From glint of steel, their daily bread.
> Far-flung from their native land,
> At nights, for home, their souls shall stand.

Ever since the black bear guai returned from Guanyin and crowned
himself king, he boasted of the arts he had learned. Tales of his newfound
method of practice and power of revival allured many a guai to Black
Wind Mountain. Seeking the king's favor, these minions toiled with
abandon.

Among them, a wolf guai worked with tireless zeal. He rose before dawn,
patrolled the mountains, and continued well into the night. All of the
treasures he found were first laid at the king's feet. His life was one of
labor, and yet, without a moment to make friends. Despite his dedication,
his presence barely stirred a whisper among the others, and his name was
seldom uttered.

His brother, seeing such unacknowledged dedication, spent his savings for
a seat in the king's lecture. The wolf guai sat there, heavy with regret for
the silver he had squandered, both on the journey here and the seat at the
lecture, that could have been used to buy himself a shield or blade. "Had I
a new blade," he mused, "glory could have been mine."

As he pondered this, golden-clad guardians scattered paper talismans
before him. Commanded to consume them, they then chanted in
meditation for hours until the king sought signs of enlightenment. The
white-robed wolf guai stood first, claiming a fervor within and clarity of
mind.

The diligent wolf guai thought to himself,"Sweating fervently in a crowd
is no marvel... Achieving clarity after chanting is no miracle." Just as he
was lost in thought, the blue ox guai rose next, followed by others. The
diligent wolf guai stayed seated, unsure, until the king gestured for them
all to sit down.

Later, treasures were doled out; the ox guai received a golden pill, the
white-robed wolf guai a title. But the diligent one kept his old shield and
dull blade, patrolling the mountain still. Only from then on, he did it all
under the white-robed one's whims, ever obedient.

## Wolf Stalwart

> Neither sky cares, nor earth will hold,
> By liquor's laugh, bold spirits unfold.
> In drunken dreams, a cosmos wide,
> Wake with worries cast aside.

Rare was the revelry for the minor guais who patrolled the mountain
paths, their delights not granted but taken in human guise, thieving
sustenance from unsuspecting townsfolk. The charade proved fleeting,
for the villagers grew wise to their deceit, and the guais, oft caught mid-
bite, were met with the town's rugged justice, deterring their mischief.

Among them was a wolf guai with a penchant for drink, who, on a day of
indolence, lay beneath an ancient tree. Suddenly, an elder wolf, cloaked in
feathers of a crane, appeared to him asking, "Why forsake your patrol for
idleness?" The wolf guai sighed, "1 long for drink, but the townsfolk see
through me; I'm left to quench my thirst only in my dreams." The elder
chuckled as he whispered a secret, "Seek the shrine. Conceal yourself
behind the curtains, and the sacred spirits' liquor shall be yours to drink."
Then, with a shift of form, he vanished.

Wavering in doubt, the wolf guai transformed and hurried to the town's
shrine. There, veiled behind curtains, a sacred effigy stood, its origins
unknown, the altar laden with delectable offerings and fine spirits. As
advised, he nestled himself between the curtains, indulging in the liquor
until his belches betrayed him to the gathering crowd in the shrine.
Trapped between the curtains, the wolf guai listened as a voice rang out,
"The wine jar I offered is empty. Our tributes were received." A chorus of
prayers erupted, beseeching favor from the Immortals.

From that day forth, folks from miles around flocked to the shrine,
affording the demon endless drink. But as days passed, the once delightful
treat turned bitter; and those prayers, be them piteous or greedy, weighed
heavily upon him with helplessness.

One day, unable to endure the bitterness any longer, the wolf guai burst
from behind the curtains, hoisting the jar and smashing it on the altar
amidst the screams of onlookers. With a deafening crash, he suddenly
awoke beneath the tree: no shrine, no incense, no crowd around. With a
tired sigh, he took up his axe and set off to patrol the mountains once
more.

## Wolf Archer

> A master archer, none can compare,
> Timid when danger fills the air.
> Never brave when faced with fear,
> Escape his choice, he stays clear.

The Black Wind King hosted a banquet in the temple to celebrate his
birthday, and all the yaoguais attended. During the feast, the King hung a
lucky ornament on a tree branch, declaring that anyone who could shoot
it would receive a rare fortifying golden pill as the reward. The yaoguais
Were eager to try, but the fierce wind hampered all their attempts.

Among the guests was an old wolf known for his remarkable archery skills.
He was cautious, unassuming, and kept to himself in a corner, nursing his
drink. A few eager yaoguais asked him to try, and though he declined, they
persisted with their teasing until he reluctantly agreed.

Slowly, the wizened old wolf stood up and moved to the position. Some
youngsters laughed at him, deeming him incapable. Unperturbed, he
calmly strung his bow, let loose an arrow, and struck the target dead
center, causing a commotion among the crowd.

The old wolf received the reward, and admiration followed suit as others
toasted him. Among them was a youngster, who commented on the bolus
intoxicated. "How generous our King is," he remarked, "Far better than
that Lingxuzi, who was good at making pills but never shared them with
his underlings. What a tightwad!" The youngster's words cast a shadow
across the old wolf's face, and he silently took his leave. "He had roamed
the mountain with Lingxuzi long before our King's reign. Yet, you judged
his deceased former master in front of him. Loyal as he is, you are in
trouble now!" warned an elder guai. However, the young guai shrugged
off his warning.

The next day, the old wolf returned the golden pill to the King, citing its
value too high to possess by an archer. Hearing the news, the other
yaoguais urged the young one to apologize and seek forgiveness, but he
remained defiant. Within a few days, while venturing outside, the
youngster was killed by several arrows, each piercing his heart. Many said
that even the golden pill couldn't save the youngster from his fate.

## Wolf Sentinel

> With his axe as both weapon and cane,
> His brows bushy, his hair white as snow,
> Who claims the twilight years are in vain?
> For learning late can still make one grow.

Long ago, the Wolf Sentinels were the personal guards of old Lingxuzi.
They were masters of the long-hafted axe, and their name was spoken in
awe among the yaoguais.

When the Black Wind King returned from Guanyin and rebuilt the
garrison in the mountain, he took in many wolf guais who had wandered
here from Shituo Ridge. This angered the wolf guais native to Black Wind
Mountain. To appease them, the Black Bear Guai pledged to revive old
Lingxuzi. The wolf guais then had no choice but to endure in silence. Yet
mere days after the awakening, the old wolf vanished, and no one had
seen him since. Upon learning of this, the black bear did not look into the
matter but allowed a senior grey wolf guai from the Kingdom of Shituo to
take old Lingxuzi's seat and even his name.

This roused the local wolf guais to fury and launched protest after protest.
To their surprise, the Wolf Sentinels, at the Black Bear Guai's behest,
seized the lesser guais who led the unrest. The new Lingxuzi flew into a
rage at these guais, threatening to devour them whole. They were spared
this fate only by the timely arrival of Guangzhi, the Fireblade Wolf.
Thereafter, under the new Lingxuzi's command, the Wolf Sentinels led
every patrol of lesser guais on the mountain. Never did anyone ever dare
rise against Lingxuzi again.

## Wolf Assassin

> Hills and rivers, nature's way,
> Kindness grows like grass and wood.
> Plants may fade, then bloom in May,
> All shall still stand where they stood.

Once upon a time, a young wolf followed a grey elder wolf to learn the art
of hunting. Despite his cleverness and diligence, the young wolf struggled
to catch any prey. One day, the pale elder commanded him to find food
alone or face hunger. Then the young wolf, hiding in the shadows of the
mountains, finally managed to catch a rabbit. However, instead of eating it
alive, he gently licked the rabbit's wounds, as if to heal them.

The rabbit took the chance and fled into a pond, struggling to swim to
safety, but the young wolf in pursuit forced it back into the water. Just as
the rabbit was about to drown, the young wolf rescued it, softly nudging
its head and helping it breathe. The rabbit woke up conscious but
bewildered. Suddenly, the distant howl of the grey elder startled both of
them. In his panic, the young wolf accidentally crushed the rabbit under
his paw.

Heartbroken, the young wolf wept bitterly. As the elder approached and
inquired, it became clear: the young wolf couldn't bring himself to kill the
rabbit, so he repeatedly spared its life. Yet, he also feared his own hunger,
and that's why he refused to let go. Acknowledged, the grey elder then
advised, "Your false kindness brought misery. Instead of hesitation, both
of you would have been better off with a swift end."

The grey elder's words seemed to have dawned upon the young wolf.
Later, it honed a lethal technique of hurling whirling blades from afar for
stealth kills, believing this to be the ultimate form of mercy towards its
adversaries.

## Croaky

> In pools they dwell, forms unrefined,
> Ugly and odd, voices entwined.
> Bellies swell with a raucous tune,
> In death, they burst-an angry boom.

Two frog guais practiced in the marshes. The smaller frog was often
bullied, yet the bigger one always stood up for him, and soon they forged a
strong friendship. One day, amid a contest held by Baw- Li-Guhh- Lang to
appoint a sergeant among all the frogs, turmoil stirred and rippled
through the ranks. Finally, the choice was narrowed down to the two, the
brawny big frog and the quick-witted small frog. Though the other frogs
were discontented, they dared not voice their dissent.

The two then were assigned to guard the dwelling of Baw-Li-Guhh-Lang.
On their duty, a valuable amber glass was found broken. Unable to identify
the culprit, all the frogs began clamoring for punishment against the two
instead. The big frog attempted to reason with them but got antagonized
by their words and soon escalated the argument into a brawl. The frogs
interpreted this as his reaction out of embarrassment, hence evidence of
his guilt. The small frog, meanwhile, remained silent beside them. Seeing
this, the big frog chided him for not speaking up in his defense and even
began to suspect his smaller companion.

Hesitated for a while, the small frog then admitted to breaking the glass.
However, the other frogs dismissed his confession, arguing that one of
them had committed premeditated vandalization while the other had
neglected his duty, and both deserved punishment by death. The small
frog grew anxious and could not help but engage in the argument. As their

voice grew louder and louder, their bellies inflated larger and larger, until
some of them finally burst, splattering blood and flesh all over the place,
leaving none unsoiled.

## Crow Diviner

> He knows the world's fate through divination,
> Yet cannot secure his own salvation.
> In what he thought was a place of peace,
> Fate's tangled threads never cease.

It is said that the crows gathering in temples, having listened to sutras and
teachings every day, developed a spiritual nature and could predict
fortune and misfortune. Thus, some fortune-tellers who called
themselves "Crow Diviners" liked to set up stalls in front of temples, using
crows to pick fortune sticks for divination. They always lit sandalwood
incense, which symbolizes the temple, at their stalls and claimed that their
crows were the spiritually enlightened ones from the temple.

One such Crow Diviner had a crow he had raised from a chick, which
could communicate with him using specially made fortune sticks. Every
day, he sent the crow to various parts of the city to observe people's lives.
When clients came to seek fortunes, he would use the fortune sticks to

inquire about information from the crows. He mixed this information with
his own understanding of human affairs, weaving prophecies that were
half-true, which often managed to deceive.
One day, an official came seeking a fortune, offering a large sum of money.
The Crow Diviner told him that his official career would be prosperous
and that he would reach a high position. Unexpectedly, the official not
only failed to get promoted that year but was demoted instead. Enraged,
the official brought his household servants to demand an explanation. The
Crow Diviner used the information gathered by the crows to explain that
the official had not spent enough money on temple renovation, which

magically convinced him. The official, deeply believing in his abilities,
even introduced the Crow Diviner to his colleagues.
The Crow Diviner amassed a considerable fortune through this, but he
knew too many secrets of the officials and feared for his life. He decided to
change his career. One day, he attempted to drive all the crows away, but
they refused to leave. The Crow Diviner tried various means to get rid of
them, but the crows, unable to endure his mistreats any longer, attacked
and pecked him to death.

Afterward, the crows transformed into human forms, donned the attire of
fortune-tellers and continued to sell fortunes around the temple,
deceiving people as the Crow Diviner had done.

## Bandit Chief

> From humble start to seek revenge's claim.
>
> > Paths may differ, yet burn with the same flame.

In bygone days, there lived a youth in the town, the son of a martial arts
master. His father's fondness for drink led to a foolish act that landed the
old man in jail, leaving only the youth and his mother struggling to
survive. As their situation grew dire, the young man took on any work to
make ends meet. The villagers praised him for caring for his mother,
deeming him a dutiful son.

In an unlucky year of crop failure, the mother and son set out to seek
refuge with relatives. Along the way, a gang of bandits emerged. Eyes
fierce, faces scarred, they brandished their blades, demanding nothing but
gold. The mother and son, destitute, resorted to begging for mercy. But
the bandits showed no mercy and were intent on killing them. The young
man, believing their death was imminent, seized a bandit's knife; with a
resolute heart, he ended his own mother's life and pledged himself to the
bandits. And so, he joined their ranks. News of the incident spread, and
people condemned him as a coward, truly a cursed son.

Years passed. One day, the entire gang of bandits was wiped out, leaving
no trace. Some said a hero had come to rid the land of evil and uphold
justice. Others claimed a guai had emerged in the mountains, bringing a
long-delayed reckoning. Debates raged on, but eventually, the topic faded
from memory. One day, a man, covered in blood, stumbled down from the
mountains, recounting an encounter with a towering bandit, neither
human nor guai, wielding a massive blade to rob the roads. His face bore
an uncanny resemblance to that cursed youth, yet he spoke of freeing
humanity from its burdens.

![Bandit Chief](/image-20240825213105041.png)

## Skeletal Snake

> A noble fate's vengeful breath,
> Binds the bones of snakes in death.
> A soul mistreated, here to stay,
> Resentful will, blown astray.

In the Village of Shaded Heights, there lived a young man, orphaned and
impoverished, constantly mistreated by his fellow villagers.

One day, hunters from the village discovered a strange cave in the
mountains, emitting eerie sounds that sent shivers down their spines. Too
afraid to enter themselves, villagers pushed the young man in to
investigate. Lost in the darkness, he stumbled and fell from a cliff, crying
out in agony. Believing the cave harbored a fearsome guai, the villagers
abandoned him and fled in terror.

Sitting at the bottom, the young man wept bitterly. Amidst his tears, he
heard the sound of bones snapping and the rustling of movement.

Startled, he fell silent, only to hear footsteps approaching. Filled with fear,
he yelled, "Stay away! I am an orphan and burdened with misery. My flesh
is lean-feasting on me won't do you any good." Surprisingly, as soon as he
spoke, the footsteps stopped.

Time passed, and within the darkness, hunger gnawed at the man's senses.
Despairingly, he pleaded, "There's no one coming for me.. Devour me
quickly, so I may have a merciful death." Then, the footsteps resumed,
inching closer. Terrified, he assumed his end was imminent. Yet, to his
astonishment, he felt a piece of cloth gently brushed against his face.
Reaching out, he realized it was a sleeve, which he grasped firmly. The
sleeve guided him to stand and led him through the darkness until they
found the cave's entrance.

As the daylight bathed them, the young man finally saw what had been
guiding him-a skeletal serpent guai! Seeing the young man startled, the
guai suddenly extended its neck and swept him out of the cave.
Afterwards, the young man was saved by passing merchants and departed
from the village with them. From then on, his life gradually improved and
prospered.

As the saying goes: "Misfortune may be the harbinger of fortune, and
fortune may conceal misfortune." While not an absolute truth, when
events reach their peak, change becomes inevitable. From change,
opportunities arise, and the lowest valleys often reveal the clearest paths.

![Skeletal Snake](/image-20240825214358935.png)

## Snake Patroller

> As seasons turn, from slumber it parts,
> Hidden in green, a hunter with arts.
> Small in shape, it devours the grand,
> Or strikes a pain no cure can stand.

In the kingdom of Hhami, a small city stood against the mountainside, its
lush grasses and dense forests a haven for serpents, much to the
townsfolk's constant dismay.

There lived in this city a snake hunter, masterful in his craft, who had
freed the people from many a serpent's threat, earning a fair share of silver
in the process. He boasted not of his wealth; instead, he often dispensed
porridge to the needy and prayed for all. So revered was he that the
magistrate awarded him a dwelling for all his family to live within the
town walls.

One day, a ragged monk, seemingly delusional, came begging at his door.
The snake hunter's kind-hearted wife offered clothes and food, but the
monk, unsatisfied, demanded liquor. The crowd scorned his impudence,
their complaints growing loud until the snake hunter's return. He
silenced the clamor and instructed his wife to bring the monk a gourd of
spirits.

Touched by the gesture, the monk warned, "A serpent guai lurks in your
home. Ignore it not, or your family shall perish." The snake hunter scoffed
at such mad ramblings and dismissed him promptly. Yet, his wife heeded
the monk's words and urged her husband to search for the guai. He,
however, brushed aside her concerns.

In her persistence, the wife fetched the mad monk once more to banish
the evil. Indeed, with raw meat and an iron hook, the monk drew from
their home a massive serpent, taller than a man, clearly a creature of
power. "Four limbs it sprouts, and venom deadly," the monk declared. "A
mere touch is death." With those words, he slew the serpent guai for the
woman.

Strangely thence, the town remained untouched by further snake
scourges, as if by the mad monk's hand, peace was restored.

## Fungiling

> As mountain rains kiss the ground,
> Youthful green is all around.
> In her virtue's quiet display,
> Even guais in the woods repay.

In the highland bounds, there lived a widow and her girl, left to fend
against the harsh days alone. The mother sold pancakes in the nearby
village; the girl gathered firewood, ground grain, and cooked meals,
shouldering her share of the family's responsibility.

Ceaseless rains had worn down the woodshed, long neglected without a
man's hand. The beams rotted, and the roof caved in. One day, the girl
found atop the ruins a gleaming mushroom, vibrant and capped like a
bowl, dew dancing on its surface, a spark of life too precious to pluck. She
sheltered it with straw, letting it thrive in peace.

Laden with tasks, the girl had no time to play with other children. All her
secrets and dreams, she whispered to the mushroom, as if it were a dear
friend.

The toils of life led the widow into illness, urgently needing money for
medicine. After discussing it, the widow and her daughter decided to sell
their house. A wealthy neighbor, who had once been close to the widow's
late husband, expressed interest in buying the house. However, this
neighbor was very stingy and tried to exploit the widow's illness to lower
the price. They spread various rumors to scare away other potential
buyers, bullying the helpless widow and her daughter.

Worried and anxious, the girl often hid in the woodshed to cry. The
mushrooms witnessed all her grievances.

The next day, something strange happened at the neighbors' house.
Overnight, mushrooms had sprouted all over their property. When the
neighbors ordered their servants to clear them away, they discovered a
large, eerie mushroom about a foot tall, neither green nor yellow, growing
on the main beam.

When they tried to cut down the mushroom with long-handled sickles, it
suddenly rose into the air, opened its cap like a fishing net, and floated
above them. It shook itself and then fell onto the man of the house,
crushing him to death. The air was filled with countless spores the
creature released, knocking everyone to the ground.

Afterward, the mushrooms crawled out of the ground, transforming into
many guais. They helped the widow and her daughter pack their
belongings and leave the village, disappearing into the mountains.

![Fungiling](/image-20240825220913838.png)

## Ginsengling

> Inherent gifts in these mystical sprouts reside,
> Walking forth from the earth, spirits untied.
> Roots serve as limbs, nourishing body and mind,
> Beware, excessive gathering brings hardships unkind.

It was written in ancient records that consuming ginseng could bestow
longevity, leading many to develop a fervent passion for devouring this
precious tuber-especially aged ones. However, some scholars dismissed
this notion, viewing ginseng as both a tonic and a poison; its elevated
status stemmed from its humanoid appearance, they said. Nonetheless,
those who made their living by harvesting ginseng always found eager
buyers.

Deep within the valley, the younglings of ginseng shoots trembled with
fear at the unmistakable sound of footsteps. It was the dreaded rhythm of
the ginseng harvesters' mountain shoes, crushing the thick layers of
decaying leaves and rocky earth. And with every eerie resonance, the
siblings of the ginseng plants vanished, disappearing one by one. Only the
tiniest survivors managed to evade this grim fate, their diminutive size
providing a fleeting reprieve. Yet, even they bore the mark of fate-a
crimson thread, marking them, and restraining them. Who knew when
the harvesters would return, to dig them up once they grew into their full
potential?

Time raced by, swift and unyielding. And on that day, the familiar
footsteps resurfaced. With the years that had passed, it was likely the
offspring of harvesters who were generations younger than those who
came before; then a quickened pace, a sense of anticipation-the crimson
threads had surely been spotted. But oh, what ill fortune! As the ginseng
harvester reached for the thread, it led him to a grim sight-the entwined
remains of a skeleton. A curse gathered on the tip of his tongue, but before
he could spit it out, the ground behind him rumbled with the sound of
scattered dirt. He turned his head; the shifting soil unleashed a monstrous
creature, towering and menacing. Fear gripped the harvester, urging him
to flee, his frantic screams piercing the air, shouting of man-devouring
guais.

## Rat Archer

> An army of bows carved with loong,
> The roars of shafts a frightening song.
> Warring on, their archery glows,
> And with tactics their glory flows.

In the days when the Kingdom of Flowing Sands warred against the
Fuban, there was a company of warriors known as the Four-Feathered
Army. Skilled archers they were, one and all, armed with repeating
crossbows and great shafts fletched with four feathers, capable of piercing
even the strongest iron. Great was the joy of these soldiers when the
weapons were placed into their hands, for they believed that with their
hard-earned skills and such mighty tools of war, victory would be swiftly
theirs.

As darkness fell, the soldiers gathered to discuss the strategies they would
employ. A veteran said, "shoot its eyes to blind it, and the bug won't be
able to hit us." A young one said, "shoot its heart to stop its breath, and the
creature will perish." Abrave one said, "shoot its legs to cripple it, and let
it wait for death." Long they debated, each seeking to sway the others, but
none could be swayed. At last, they resolved to each follow their own
strategy and see which would prevail on the field.

The next day, the Four- Feathered Army lined up in neat rows. At the given
signal, a storm of arrows was released. Yet each archer aimed as they
judged best, and not a single shaft found its mark in the same place as
another.

The hide of the Fuban was so thick that the rain of arrows served only to
vex the creature. In the end, the valiant soldiers were scattered and put to
flight.
Alas, minds divided need not always agree, yet the strength of one alone
has its limits. In unity lies true strength, and only with a single purpose can
the greatest deeds be accomplished. A fellowship divided against itself
cannot endure, but is ever doomed to ruin.

![Rat Archer](/image-20240825222811297.png)

## Rat Soldier

> Helmets bright and halberds keen,
> Marching where the war-banners lean.
> To the border's drum, they march in time,
> Behind their shields, their courage climbs.

In Sandgate Village, a rat widow grieved; her husband, devoured by the
Tiger Vanguard, had left nothing behind but his Sand Shield, a royal
reward. Her sons, born after their father's demise, were her last hope.
Pointing to the shield, she decreed to her growing sons, "If you don't slay
that tiger, you're no sons of mine." And so they trained with the Second
Prince, vowing to take vengeance on the Tiger Vanguard.

Among them, one boy, frail and ill-suited for combat, loved ink and paper
over spear and shield. His mother's scolding and punishments were
frequent, forcing him to commit to the martial arts. He did try hard, yet
his efforts only left him feeble and trembling. The same skill that took only
a few days to acquire for his peers could take him weeks with no
noticeable progress. Even the Prince urged him to explore a different path,
therefore the boy's enthusiasm for martial waned further.

As his brothers donned red armor and golden shields, he stood alone,
enduring more beatings and scorn. Once, his mother went too far with her
harsh words, "Better to be eaten by the tiger than remain useless at home,"
which drove him to steal his father's shield and spear to fulfill his mother's
wish. The Tiger Vanguard knocked him down in two moves, mouth
opened for a gulp.

But stones were hurled, striking the tiger in his head. Startled, the Tiger
Vanguard gazed around for the culprit. Some of the rats seized the
moment, dragging away their kin from the tiger's grip. The Vanguard
turned to chase, but there stood the rat soldiers, those who had never
ventured from the dunes, now spears pointed, shields hoisted-a line of
defiance so fierce, they dared the tiger to challenge them. The tiger
hesitated, and the rats left safely.

That boy did later forsake the warrior's way, but he took up his bow
alongside the rat archers. With a sharp mind and truer aim, he even saved
his kin in turn.

## Rat Governor

> Through omens, he sensed impending blight,
> Yet he turned away, veering from the light.
> Unaware, the days of plenty ceased to flow,
> The nation, infested with rodents, lost its glow.

In same year that Kingdom of Sahali was renamed as Kingdom of Flowing
Sands, the "Rodent Reverence Edict" was proclaimed throughout the
country. This edict declared rats as celestial beings protected by the king's
law, making it illegal to harm them. Whosoever breached this
commandment would face the king's judgment. Hence, rat guais from
across the land flocked to the kingdom. Although strife ensued between
commoners and guais, none dared defy the king's decree. For the well-
being of people, the scholars of the Royal Academy planned a petition to
implore the segregation of rat guais to the southwest corner of the capital.

Among these scholars, there was an elder who was deeply skilled in
divination. On the day of the petition, right before the scholars were to
meet the king, the elder divined for his career, which came out as a grave
omen. "Not an auspicious time for it," he told his students the omen in
secret, "I advise you to take sick leave with me today". However, his
students, faithful and young, heeded him not and went forth gallantly.

Just as the elder stepped outside the palace, the Royal Guards encircled
the hall. Shouts of agony then filled the air, unfolding the bloodshed
within. Hands covering his trembling ears, the elder slowly made his way
home. After three kingless assemblies and a major court reshuffle, he was
promoted to Grand Governor, a rank that bestowed him years of wealth
and glory. But one day, as he peered into a bronze mirror, he noticed that
his nose was elongated, and bristles had sprouted on both sides.

Henceforth, he forsook mirrors, knowing he would always bear a rat's
visage like all those absented from that petition.

## Rat Captain

> A visage strange with shoulders wide,
> Two heads upon them side by side,
> Before the royal grace be repaid,
> My steadfast heart will never fade.

In the Kingdom of Zhuzi, a woman gave birth to a two-headed child,
causing great horror throughout the cities.

People lamented the unfortunate fate of the woman and her child,
predicting that the child would be difficult to raise. Contrary to their
expectations, the child not only survived past infancy but also grew
stronger and healthier than most others. The folks then again speculated
that while the child might grow up, he would surely be a fool. However, as
the child matured, he proved to be quite intelligent. His two heads gave
him a unique perspective, allowing him to come up with ideas that others
couldn't.

Disappointed by their failed predictions, the folks declared the child to be
an ill omen, foretelling future disasters. The constant rumors eventually
drove the two-headed youth to leave his hometown.

Years later, a beetle with a stone-carved Buddha head attacked the border
of the Kingdom of Sahali. The king dispatched his army to defend the city,
but they suffered repeated defeats. Morale plummeted, and as thoughts of
retreat began to plague the soldiers' hearts, a tall, two-headed man in the
army stood out and volunteered to lead an elite squad in a raid against the
yaoguai.

On the day of the battle, he arranged his elite soldiers in a line. When the
yaoguai attacked, they threw coal dust on it and then sprayed strong
liquor from their mouths to create pillars of fire that detonated the coal
dust. Terrified by the fire, the yaoguai quickly withdrew into the desert.

Seeing that this tactic could temporarily repel the yaoguai, the King was
greatly relieved and appointed the two-headed man as a captain. Learning
that his children were also two-headed, the king decreed that the position
of captain would be hereditary in his family, encouraging his children to
join the army and strengthen the forces. One can only wonder what the
folks from his hometown would say upon hearing such news.

## Rat Imperial Guard

> Yin prevails, yang's essence fades,
> Adorned in finery, blades parade.
> Once malice stirs within the heart,
> Words become weapons, tearing apart.

Since the Yellow Wind King had sequestered himself within the valley, his
hoarded treasures were left to the care of his trusted minions. One day,
when a purple-gold incensory vanished from the half-emptied storeroom,
the rumor of theft, once a mere murmur, built into a raucous clamor, until
the rat guai who guarded the storeroom was finally accused of pilfering
from his own charge.

The tale reached the ears of the Rat Imperial Guards. Clad in crimson, they
were the secret imperial enforcers. They went to interrogate the rat guard,
hoping for a share of the spoils; but the humiliated guard was found
lifeless, his neck wedged in a noose, dangling in his cell.

With his death, the gossipmongers painted the Imperial Guards as vilifiers
of the innocent, coercing false confessions. With no means to defend
themselves, the Imperial Guards launched a thorough inquiry, desperate
to clear their names. Fortune struck when they unearthed the incensory
within the nest of the rat guard's apprentice. The crowd's scorn shifted,
branding the young apprentice a betrayer and avaricious soul.

Yet, in the face of the Imperial Guards' iron grip, the apprentice unfurled a
new thread of the story; the incensory had been pilfered by the Civet
Sergeant, as a tribute to the Tiger Vanguard. It was the apprentice who,
learning of his master's unjust fate, dared to retrieve it in secret. Verified
by the Imperial Guards, the tale swayed public sentiment once more, from
jeers to praise. But whispers are like a fickle breeze. Soon, it was murmured
that the thieving Chief acted not out of greed, but out of a son's duty; to
rescue his mother from the bowels of the Tiger Temple. The crowds
murmured anew, their judgment as shifting as the sands.

Alas, what is a grain of truth in a desert of tales? Actions taken in the cloak
of shadows are often proclaimed in light as something else entirely.

Perhaps it is the angle from which we plead our cause that crafts a
different truth. And when a truth finds the light, it is often because some
prefer an audience blind to the rest of the story.

![Rat Imperial Guard](/image-20240825225156758.png)

## Pitstone

> The mystic's art breathes life into stone,
> A servant bestowed, but caution be shown.
> A nature fierce, beware its provocation,
> For crossing its path brings fatal devastation.

Once upon a time, there lived a pretentious scholar who took great pride
in a paperweight he collected. Whenever his guests commented that it
was merely an ordinary stone with no notable features, the scholar would
respond by sharing a peculiar tale.

During his adventurous youth, the scholar embarked on a treacherous
journey. Exhausted and seeking respite, he leaned against a massive stone
for a snooze. Suddenly, he felt the stone come alive. Skeletons emerged
from its crevices, and the stone sprouted limbs, resembling a grotesque
creature. Terrified, the scholar ran for his life until he stumbled upon a
desolate valley, where he noticed a gaunt monk meditating atop a
boulder. Struck by the peculiar sight, he contemplated fleeing once more.
Yet, to his astonishment, he sensed the relentless pursuit of the stone
creature from behind. Just as he stood on the verge of being crushed, the
very boulder beneath the monk unexpectedly rose, revealing two mighty
arms that pummelled and shattered the pursuing creature. Amidst this
terrifying clash, the scholar barely managed to escape. And the
paperweight, as he claimed, was a remnant of that cataclysmic fight.

The guests erupted into laughter upon hearing the tale, mocking the
scholar for spicing up his wild dream to impress them. The scorned
scholar, though indignant, began to doubt the truth of his tale himself and
lost interest in the paperweight. Eventually, he banished it to a forgotten
corner, never to be shown again.

![Pitstone](/image-20240826205846799.png)

## Palestone

> Mighty and strong, its presence grand,
> With secret quartz, like shimmering sand.
> Chosen for the righteous, a sacred embrace,
> Nature's justice reflected, in its grace.

In a small kingdom west of the Black Wind Mountain, the ageing king
lived in constant fear of his dwindling lifespan. Desperate to find the elixir
of longevity, he embarked on a frantic search for a solution.

One day, an immortalist informed the king that consuming quartz could
extend his life and bestow eternal youth. Upon hearing this, the king
immediately issued a royal decree, commanding his subjects to scour the
lands in search of quartz. Eager to claim their reward, stone miners
ventured deep into the desolate Yellow Wind Ridge. There, they came
across a stone being with an enormous head adorned with a brilliant white
mineral-quartz.

News of the discovery reached the king, who promptly dispatched his
crown prince with an army to collect the precious quartz. Little did they
know that as they ventured into the ridge, they would be enveloped by
swirling dust and relentless yellow winds. Cunning and treacherous, the
stone beings lurked beneath the earth, lying in wait. Whenever someone
approached, they would swarm out in a coordinated ambush, ensnaring
their unsuspecting prey from both sides. The army suffered heavy
casualties before obtaining even a trace of the coveted quartz. In a state of
desperation, a messenger was dispatched to the capital, bearing a plea of
withdrawal that detailed the perilous expedition and the dreadful
calamities befalling the men. However, the aged king remained steadfast
in his resolve, insistent on obtaining a substantial amount of quartz.

Eventually, the crown prince returned with the coveted quartz and an
army halved, and requested to present the precious mineral to his father
in the royal chamber. Seizing the opportunity, he initiated a coup, and
plunged a knife into the king's heart, leaving him to die holding his
cherished quartz of longevity on his bed.

![Palestone](/image-20240826210554952.png)

## Poisestone

> Agile and extraordinary, with strength untold,
> Delicate in form, light as a feather's hold.
> Pure beauty, untouched by mortal's trace,
> Proud as a frost-kissed maiden's grace.

Before obtaining the Stone Essence, the Mother of Stones was originally a
blue quartz in the shape of a woman.

The blue quartz had the unique ability to absorb the essence of the moon.
Through ages of absorption, she attained enlightenment earlier than other
stone guais and was honored as the mountain deity.

When the Buddha-head stone guai appeared, the other stone guais
convened and decided to expel the guai from the mountain. They sought
the help of the Mother of Stones. However, she refused, fearing the
possibility of her blue quartz to be shattered in battle.

Yet on the day of battle, seeing that the stone guais were on the verge of
defeat, she could no longer bear to stand by and decided to join the fight.
Noticing the Palestones launching their quartz like a barrage of arrows to
sneak attack the Buddha-head guai, she imitated their action despite her
deep attachment to her precious quartz.

Despite their best efforts, they were still losing. When her blue quartz was
shattered by a punch, the Mother of Stones fell to the ground in despair.
Unexpectedly, a yellow-furred leading a group of yaoguais came to their
aid. Seeing her grievance, the rat persuaded, "What is broken is destined
not to return. If we let the guai escape, wouldn't it be an even greater
loss?""

Hearing this, the Mother of Stones regained her strength and rose up.
Together, they subdued the Buddha-head stone guai. As compensation for
her loss, the yellow-furred rat gifted her the Stone Essence.

With the essence bestowed, the Mother of Stones gained great powers.
Yet as her form grew less mobile, she crafted Poisestones from blue quartz,
reflections of her former self, to watch over the mountain's happenings.
Perhaps she did this to glimpse what she once was, what could never
return

![Poisestone](/image-20240826211031772.png)

## Blazebone

> On the road, bare bones on display,
> Flesh rotted, decayed, faded away.
> Long gone, forgotten in name,
> His homeland lost, in death's claim.

In the land of Yellow Wind Ridge, where relentless winds raged day and
night, the tomb mounds were often ravaged by the mighty gusts, revealing
the exposed bones-a sight all too familiar.

One day, a hurried merchant found himself passing through Yellow Wind
Ridge on an urgent matter. However, the villagers warned him of the
terrible danger and refused to be his guide. After walking alone for hours,
the merchant rested by the roadside, eating his rations. It was then that he
noticed a set of skeletal remains in the withered grass. The bones were
incomplete due to greedy vultures and wolves. "Were you slain by
bandits, lying here in this desolate place? Or, like me, did you find no joy in
life and chose to end it yourself?" Overwhelmed with sorrow, the
merchant sighed as he looked upon the skull and wondered aloud. "You
now lie uncovered in the wilderness, and I can only imagine the sorrow
your family must feel." Moved by compassion, he untied his bundle,
Weeping as he began to dig a grave to bury the remains.
Suddenly, the skeleton sat up, startling the merchant, who fell to the
ground and scrambled backwards in fear. Using bony hands to support
itself, the skeleton approached the merchant and pushed the bundle
towards him. Astonished, the merchant cautiously accepted the bundle
and resumed his journey. The skeleton followed him from a distance, and
together they travelled peacefully for hours. Gradually, the merchant let
his guard down, and removed his inner shirt to drape it over the skeleton's
frame.

From that moment on, whenever a strange noise arose, the skeleton
would guide the merchant to take cover behind rocks. With furtive
glances, the merchant would then witness guais passing by the path. For
several days, they continued on this way until the merchant finally
reached the main road again. That was the moment the skeleton ceased to
move. Grateful for its companionship, the merchant offered to transport
the skeleton's remains back to its homeland. However, after a moment's
hesitation, the skeleton turned and walked back into the swirling sands of
the ridge. Perhaps, it had already forgotten where it came from.

![Blazebone](/image-20240826211810014.png)

## Spearbone

> In a world where paths are never clear,
> Where directions are oft lost in fear.
> In the spear-tip a mighty and noble stand,
> Behind the shield, a pride so grand.

The priests of Windrest were proud warriors. Their shields were
emblazoned with the tiger, and they danced with crescent-shaped spears,
commanding a presence that frightened off guais. During funerals, they
would lead the procession, striking their shields and proclaiming
themselves as leading generals.

The priests held a high status in Windrest. Even the minor guais in the
mountain would frequently offer them rare delicacies, hoping to ensure
their peace and to avoid being banished.

One day, a settler noticed an increase in the mountain's guai population
and sought the advice of the sorcerers. Dismissive, the priests responded,
"The guais and us, we inhabit the same mountains; an encounter would be
inevitable. Since they present us with tributes, we might as well spare
them."

A few years later, strange winds began to sweep across the valley, stirring
up chaos. The guais ran wild, causing trouble frequently. Dressed in their
warrior attire, the priests raised their shields and ventured out of the
settlement to confront the unruly guais.

However, the guais didn't fear them. The priests' spears and shields, which
were once their pride, could only repel a few minor ones before they were
surrounded. The leader, a red-robed rat, sneered, "We had peace only
because of the Bodhisattva meditating up in these mountains. You mortals
surely didn't think you could actually defeat us, did you?""
Seeing the priests unable to repel the guais and instead provoking their
anger, the settlers locked the gate of Windiest, demanding that the guais
be expelled before they could return.

The priests met their end on the mountains, remaining in their battle
stances, serving as ominous omens to those who pass by.

![Spearbone](/image-20240826212442108.png)

## Swift Bat

> In shadows deep, the bat guai lies,
> Far from clamor, under the skies.
> In moonlit hues, blood it sips,
> As through yellow wind, it slips.

After the harvest, the rentman arrived in the village. The villagers cleaned
a long-abandoned manor for his stay and treated him to a sumptuous
feast. Full from food and drink, the village chief spoke directly, "The rent
is a heavy burden on us. Is there any possibility to reduce it?" The rent
collector replied, "The rent has been determined by your lord. I'm but a
paid man tasked with taking what is due. I have no power to change it."

The talk turned into an unending argument. As dusk approached, the
villagers hastily left. An old widower lingered, offering a suggestion to the
rentman, "Our village offers little amusement, but on that hill, there's a
pavilion fine for moon gazing. Should you grow weary, 'tis a place to ease
your mind." With these words, he too departed.

That night, the rentman, lantern in hand, pondered his ledgers and the
days of disputes ahead. Seeking solace, he walked toward the pavilion. But
as he stepped into the courtyard, a figure descended with wings of flesh,
claws for hands, and a maw of pointed teeth. Terrified, he fled, only to be
ambushed by a similar creature lurking in the trees. The bat guais
squabbled over him for the first bite, chittering and chattering.
Seeing them locked in a stalemate, the rentman drew a blade from his belt
and beheaded one. The other sprang, fangs bared towards him, but he
dodged it with a struggled roll. That night, the rentman and the bat
dogfought, fangs and blade clashed until dawn.

Come morning, villagers come to the manor to prepare the rentman his
morning meal, only to find him sitting by the door, a blade at his side,
pinning two headless bat corpses to the earth. In the days that followed,
they paid their full rent and hosted another rich feast, sending the
rentman back to the town with due respect.

## Withered Corpse

> In my lowly life, the end is here,
> Soul adrift, my body lingers there.
> Once suffered the wicked wind's cruel sting,
> No peace shall wandering ever bring.

In the shadow of Yellow Wind Ridge, where gusts weave labyrinths of
sand, trade seldom reached here save for a lone hamlet downhill-the only
bazaar in the land. Among the market stands, an Everlife Shop stood as the
sole purveyor of coffins.

On that fateful day, the shopkeeper idled inside when a man of lumbering
gait entered, garbed like a beggar. As the shopkeeper rose to shoo him
away, the man spoke, "Hold, sir. I've come not to beg but to buy coffins."
With quiet words, he told of his village laid to ruin by bandits and his need
for four coffins to lay the dead to rest. Suspicious but intrigued, the
shopkeeper agreed to a trade in their native herbs, Suoyang and Congrong.

The shopkeeper gathered his lads and followed the man, with four coffins
on an oxcart. Laboring through sand and wind, they reached the village at
dusk. Here, the man muttered, "'All life ends and returns to earth.' These
winds can do harm, and if our bodies are not properly buried, our souls
might be twisted. Please, sir, bury my family with these coffins. We had
Suoyang and Congrong in our hearth. Take as much as you like." And with
that, he vanished.

Entering the village, the shopkeeper found all living things slaughtered,
not a soul left alive. There, before a grand dwelling, lay the man and his
kin-long dead. Hurriedly, they entombed the four corpses atop a scenic
cliff, took nothing, and fled for their lives.

![Withered Corpse](/image-20240826223000123.png)

## Weasel Captain

> Wise in the guais' wayward hearts,
> Yet shuns the lonely monkish arts.
> On the yellow ridge of desolation,
> Ends a tale by separation.

Ever since the strange winds stirred again at Yellow Wind Ridge, life had
grown harsh for the lesser guais. Tiger Vanguard and the King of Flowing
Sands fought for dominance, troubling the weasel kin caught between the
two powers.

One day, the Weasel Captain sat by the sandfield, brooding over years of
humiliation. Thoughts of death took hold in him, and he found a withered
tree. He hung his belt, stepped on a pile of stones, and slipped his head
through the noose. Regret came as he kicked away the stones. In agony
and dizziness, he struggled, but freedom eluded him.

Just then, someone held his feet, and a gleaming sickle sliced through the
air, cutting the noose. The Weasel Captain collapsed, gasping for air, and
saw a gaunt crone with a medicine basket. "If you loathe to die, live well,"
she said, and left, unbothered by his nature.

Transforming into a weasel, the Weasel Captain followed her home-a
dwelling with crumbling walls and an empty barn. She lived alone after
the death of her husband and son, foraging for herbs to trade in order to
survive. The Captain, moved by their shared misfortunes, decided to stay
and help.

Disguised as an old man fleeing famine, he claimed to be alone and found
shelter with the crone. By day, he hunted in Yellow Wind Ridge; by night,
he enlisted stone sprites to mend the house. Together, they thrived, much
to the villagers' envy.

One day, two villagers trailed the Captain, curious about his hunting
prowess. Little did they know, as they watched him, that he would
suddenly transform back into his original form-a clothed weasel guai, with
a gleaming curved blade at his waist. Feeling threatened by a non-human,
the villagers spread their tale, and a Daoist was summoned to slay the
Weasel Captain. Not long after the weasel guai was killed, the crone
passed away. The villagers, deeming the house cursed, divided the hides
and herbs before setting the place ablaze.

## Civet Sergeant

> Neglecting work, indulging in ease,
> In quiet comfort, seeking to please.
> When children misbehave and play,
> They turn fierce like wolves in disarray.

Once, there was a rich landlord who had built many houses. Among them,
there was a court where none lived. It had a clear pond, an old elm, and a
swing. The village children longed to play there.

The landlord, however, ordered his servants to guard the court and allow
no one near. As days passed, the children grew bolder. They began
throwing pebbles to draw the guards away, hoping to sneak in.
The day soon came when one of the servants was struck in the eye by a
pebble they threw. Enraged, the landlord decided to dismiss the
guardians of the court and simply locked the gate, posting a notice that
read: "Beware the civet guai within. Enter at your own risk!""

The young ones dismissed the warning as nothing but an empty threat.
They scaled the walls, gathered the elm seeds, played on the swing, and
caught fish in the clear waters of the pond. Their laughter echoed through
the court.

All of a sudden, tiles from the roof came hurtling down, landing near the
children. Startled, they cried out loud and drew their parents to the court.
The adults arrived, shouting for the owner of the place and demanding
recompense for the peril that had befallen their children.

After much shouting, a sharp voice rang out from the rear roof: "Be gone,
mortals, lest you seek your doom!" At those words, two blades whirled out
from nowhere, spinning in a deadly dance, and left wounds upon many. In
terror, the crowd turned and fled.

![Civet Sergeant](/image-20240826224350743.png)

## Lingzhiling

> Deep in the woods, beneath the trees,
> Where mountains green and waters please,
> It guards its friends with gentle ease,
> But gathers strength when threats it sees.

In the highland bounds, a famed wine estate thrived, renowned for its
medicinal brews. These beverages, with their enchanting aroma and
exquisite flavor, were beloved by the people, and its business flourished.
The master of the estate had two sons, coming of age, noble in their
aspirations yet prideful in their hearts. Cared not for the art of brewing,
they spent their time seeking the company of heroes, heedless of their
father's admonishments.

It was at this time that a bereaved family in the village uncovered a
disturbing incident-the desecration of their loved one's grave. The
villagers gathered there, only to discover the shattered coffin lid and
clusters of fungi where the corpse should have lain. Such sporadic
incidents had occurred before, yet remained unresolved, prompting the
brothers to uncover the truth.

Day after day, they scoured the mountains. Until one fateful night, as the
two stealthily returned home in the darkest hour, they caught a glimpse of
a figure disappearing into their brewery cellar. They pursued the
presumed thief, only to discover a monstrous creature capped with a
blood-red lingzhi mushroom. Without hesitation, the brothers lunged
forward, slaying the creature on the spot.

The sounds startled the master, who arrived only to find the lingzhi
creature lying dead. Filled with a mix of anger and frustration, he revealed
that the creature was in fact the brewer of the finest beverage of the estate.
His sons, who had been intent on showcasing their conquest, were filled
with shame and regret, and dared not utter another word.

Their business dwindled in the years that followed; a once grand manor in
disarray. Unable to endure the situation any longer, the brothers resolved
to leave home in search of a new life. Prior to their departure, the aged
master hosted a grand feast, bidding farewell to them alongside relatives
and friends. Curiously, after their departure, the business suddenly
flourished once more. Only the master knew the reason behind it. Every
midnight, two monstrous beings, bearing an uncanny resemblance to his
sons, with lingzhi mushroom caps atop their heads, would toil to craft the
finest brews for the brewery.

![Lingzhiling](/image-20240826224908625.png)

## Supporter Monk

> Strength unused, with no place due,
> Lifting stones, a task askew.
> Eyes so bright, yet lost in haze,
> An empty gaze, lost in self's maze.

In the past, the craftsmen building the grand hall in the New West
frequently encountered strange occurrences, leading many to quit.
Curious, one craftsman sought out the abbot, reputed to be a high monk,
for answers.

The abbot, without hesitation, led him to the Great Pagoda, where he
revealed the Lantern Warden. The craftsmen were terrified, having heard
tales of yaoguais in their youth but never having seen one. At that
moment, a wondrous sound echoed through the Great Pagoda, and the
Lantern Warden emitted a blinding light, causing the craftsmen to lose
their sight. They cried out in despair.

The abbot smiled and said,"To see the truth, one must be willing to
sacrifice even sight. You might as well stay here in this temple and practice
the path to ultimate bliss with me. Perhaps you will have the chance to
transcend and reach the Buddha's realm."

Realizing they were now blind and unable to find work, the craftsmen
decided to abandon the secular life and join the temple. They asked the
abbot how they should practice, and he replied, "Whatever you are skilled
at, practice that."

The craftsmen, known for their great strength, decided to pursue
enlightenment through martial arts. Despite their blindness, they trained
under the temple's Overseeing Monks. They tied large stones to iron
chains and attached them to their wrists, lifting them daily. This also
conveniently prepared the stones needed for the temple's construction.
The abbot was pleased and appointed them as Supporter Monks, saving a
considerable amount in labor costs.

![Supporter Monk](/image-20240826235949323.png)

## Blade Monk

> A foolish monk hears a wise voice divine,
> Beheading seen as practice, an evil so refined.
> Crooked paths lead to ever twisted ways,
> The wicked blade awakens, yet the mind still strays.

The yakshas who sought refuge in the New West were mostly unwilling to
sever their old grudges and thus served as lay disciples in the temple.
Some yakshas, however, aspired to attain enlightenment and shaved their
hair to become inner disciples. They had promised their master to sever a
thousand heads to prove their resolve. Yellowbrow was pleased and
bestowed upon them special blades, calling them "Blade Monks," and
allowed them to practice in the Pagoda Realm. If they truly managed to
behead a thousand foes, they could become Arhats in the main hall.

Initially, the Blade Monks thought this task would be easy, as the Pagoda
Realm was filled with newcomers on the path of enlightenment. However,
the path grew more challenging as they found the remaining inhabitants
of the Pagoda Realm to all be formidable adversaries: the agile and elusive
Starved Abominations, whom they couldn't catch; the long-limbed
Lantern Wardens, whom they dared not provoke; the temperamental
Enslaved Yakshas, whose cruel vengeance they feared; and even the
weakest Yaksha Archers, who had become mad and terrifying after
practicing the Closed- Eye Meditation technique.

Seeing that the Red-Haired Yakshas often sat quietly alone, appearing very
docile, they decided to target them. Although the Red- Haired Yakshas
believed all beings deserved to live, he harbored a deep hatred for those
who beheaded others due to the war that destroyed their nation, and their
own fate. Thus, he showed no mercy and promptly beheaded the Blade
Monks who attempted to do so.

After this lesson, the Blade Monks became subdued but remained
resentful. They often hid in corners, ambushing passers-by to add to their
count of beheading through their treacherous means.

## Censor Holder

> Incense sticks break, the iron censer cold,
> Frost cuts, winds slash, thin are the monk's robes.
> Bitter be the path of cultivation's quest,

Elusive bliss, hidden truths, the soul's dreams oppressed.
Years ago, a merchant sought to cross the New West to conduct business.
He should have taken the official road around the mountain, but due to a
limited budget and dwindling supplies, he decided to take a shortcut over
the mountain.

Not long after venturing upon the mountain, he lost his way. The path was
blocked by snow, and the cold was biting. The merchant, both freezing
and frightened, was at a loss, when he saw an ascetic monk, bare-chested
and carrying a censer, passing by on a nearby slope. In a moment of
desperation, the merchant hurriedly dragged his goods and followed the
monk. The monk walked slowly, but the merchant, burdened by his
goods, moved even slower and could never quite catch up.

In this manner, the two of them, one leading and one following, climbed
to the mountain's peak, where a grand temple stood. Overjoyed, the
merchant planned to rest there and hire some monks to help carry his
goods over the mountain, but as he approached the temple gate, he
became wary. There were many monks standing like statues in the snow,
completely motionless.

The merchant was alarmed and frantically searched for the monk who had
led him. Suddenly, he heard footsteps and saw several monks carrying
censers walking among the frozen bodies. They surrounded the merchant,
and just as he was about to plead for his life, a cold mist rose from the
censers, freezing him in place among the snow-covered corpses.

## Circus Monkey

> Through hoops they leap, and somersault,
> With drums and tricks, their skills exalt.
> The wicked stride with fearless ease,
> The kind are burdened, souls aggrieved.

Years ago, after Mount Huaguo was destroyed, the Macaque Chief led his
followers away, seeking a new place to practice. They trekked to the
Flaming Mountains, hoping to settle there. However, a plague soon broke
out among the monkeys. The Macaque Chief ordered the sick monkeys to
be thrown into a deep valley. This action instilled fear among the
monkeys, causing them to abandon him and wander aimlessly.

They traveled through mortal cities, disguising themselves as circus
monkeys to earn a living. However, after each performance, the audience
would disperse, leaving them with meager earnings and empty bellies.
One day, a monkey had a sudden idea: why not use their performances to
gather people together and then rob them? With that thought, they beat
their drums and gongs, performing energetically to attract a crowd. Once
the audience had gathered, they killed them, stripped them of their
clothes and valuables, and fled to the next city.

It was in this manner that they eventually reached the New West, and
upon hearing that the Macaque Chief was also practicing there, they
decided to become monks. Feeling the weight of his guilt toward his kin,
the Macaque Chief avoided them, which only fueled their resentment.
Knowing they were no match for the Macaque Chief, they took on the role
of welcoming guests, so that by striking a gong, they could summon other
guais patrolling the area. They waited every day for the chance to see the
Macaque Chief, planning to summon the local guais and give him a good
beating when the time came!

## Overseeing Monk

> With closed eyes, he practices through mere fist,
> In silence, discerns the loyal from the twist.
> Cutting thoughts, he seeks the pure domain,
> Desires quelled, new bonds are slain.

In the temple, all monks could seek guidance from those more skilled.
Among them, the monks who were passionate about fist martial arts
always followed the second senior disciple, Non-Able, to practice and
train. Their temperament was also similar to Non-Able's, as they were
most inclined to fight for justice, earning them the title of "Overseeing
Monks."

Since the Non-Able was punished by the master and sent to the Towers of
Karma to reflect on his mistakes, the Overseeing Monks lost their
protector. As a result, they often suffered greatly when standing up for
others.

Troubled, the Overseeing Monks went to ask the master the solution. The
master smiled and said, "If you do not see, your mind will be free from
obstacles. The greatest affliction of men is weakness. Close your eyes and
focus on your own cultivation.."

Initially, the Overseeing Monks covered their eyes with cloth, but when
they removed the cloth, they still couldn't ignore what they saw and
heard. Then, Yellowbrow suggested, "Why not try gouging out your
eyes?.

From then on, the temple had a new skill named "Blind Zen". Practitioners
of this art nurtured their minds to be as serene as still waters, by turning a
blind eye to the distractions of the world.
But can they truly attain stillness? Perhaps any slight sound would only
further agitate their restless hearts.

## Dual-Blade Monk

> Clad in red attire, with twin blades in hand,
> His pristine edges dance and gleam, their spirit bold and grand.
> Within each blade resides, a hidden art concealed,
> Midlife brings true wisdom, the balanced path revealed.

In days past, a monk wielding twin blades sought out New Thunderclap
Temple, hoping to learn more advanced techniques there.
His blades were plain in appearance, thus, upon entering the New West
and seeing the dazzling and peculiar weapons of the yakshas, he was filled
with envy. In his childhood, he had once admired a pair of ornate blades,
but his master had scolded him for his vanity: "Focusing on the beauty of
your weapon will only lead you astray in martial arts."
The monk had taken these words to heart, but now, seeing that others did
not adhere to this principle, he began to waver.

He approached the yakshas, inquiring about the aesthetics of their swords.
The yakshas were puzzled and replied, "The more beautiful the blades, the
more I want to practice with them. How could that be a hindrance?"
Still uncertain, the monk sought advice from his senior, Non- Pure, who
Was skilled with a monk's spade. Non- Pure replied, "Since you have
already mastered your techniques, why cling to the past?""

Taking this to heart, the monk abandoned his old blades and, inspired by
the yakshas' ornate designs, forged himself a pair of new, elaborate blades,
hoping to fulfill his childhood dream. However, despite their striking
appearance, the new ones were not the familiar, plain ones he had used for
years, and with these new weapons, new flaws were revealed in the
techniques he had honed over so many years.

Alas, spring gives birth, summer nurtures, autumn harvests, and winter
stores. All things have their seasons. Gaining something out of season,
even if obtained, is still a loss. Understanding the right moment for all
things is indeed a difficult lesson to learn!

## Cyan Bat

> Iron-forked spear in hand,
> Clothed in simple garb, humble did he stand.
> Deep woods, a world of white,
> A perfect hunting land in sight.

In the past, there was a butcher named Wang in Changuang Village.
Orphaned at a young age, his mother couldn't support him, so she sent
him to apprentice with a butcher at the foot of the mountain, where he
honed his skills.

One day, a wealthy family in town was celebrating a birthday and invited
Wang to slaughter pigs and sheep. Pleased with his work, the host
rewarded him with a leg of pork. Wang decided to bring the pork leg back
to his mother and set off for the village that night. Halfway there, he saw a
man by the roadside, holding a hunting spear and wearing an old cloth
shirt. The man called out, "Brother, I'm a hunter from the village, trapping
rabbits down this slope. I'm afraid of ghosts at night; may I walk with
you?"

Wang nodded in agreement, and they continued on their way. After a
while, the hunter started a conversation, "Brother, have you heard? There
have been reports of yaoguais on this mountain path recently." Wang
laughed, "What's there to fear about yaoguais? I have a butcher's knife at
my waist and a pork leg on my shoulder. If I encounter a yaoguai, I'll swing
the pork leg at it and chop it with my knife." The hunter forced a smile.
After walking a bit further, the hunter said, "Brother, you must be very
skilled if you're not afraid of yaoguais." Wang laughed again, "I've been
slaughtering animals since I was a child. One strike can hit the vital spot,
and one chop can break bones and tendons." The hunter, annoyed, said,
"How can you compare yaoguais to animals?" Wang replied seriously,
"There are no yaoguais in this world. Those who uphold justice are heroes;
those who bully the innocent are simply foul beasts." The hunter, unsure
how to respond, walked on in silence.

As the village came into view, the hunter hesitated and said, "Since you're
not afraid, why not turn around and look at me?" Wang had already
suspected the hunter was a yaoguai. He swung the pork leg, knocking the
hunter to the ground, and raised his knife to strike. The yaoguai, losing its
composure, quickly spread its wings and flew into the air, spitting, "Today
I met a tough one, bad luck, bad luck!" With that, it fled immediately.

Ah, they say the soft persimmons are easier to squeeze, hence it's better to
be strong. Stand firm, and even yaoguais will fear you a bit.

![Cyan Bat](/image-20240827002533963.png)

## Frozen Corpse

> Wisdom's lamp lights seasons' span,
> Time flows like water through our hands.
> Snow and wind obscure the way,
> Achievements drift like bubbles, grand.
> The temple rules state: New monks entering the temple may receive a new
> kasaya.

One day, Master Non- Void joyfully welcomed a new disciple and
personally led him to the storeroom to fetch a kasaya.
The young disciple found that the kasaya was made of a single layer of
cloth, hardly adequate for the snowy mountains. He asked, "Master, this
thin kasaya seems suitable for summer. Could I exchange it for a woolen
one?"

Non- Void shook his own kasaya and said, "The one I wear is the same as
the one in your hands, only more ornate. With the Buddha's wisdom in
your heart, you shall fear the cold no more."

The young disciple, still doubtful, asked, "Master, I saw many seniors
frozen to death by the roadside..."

Non- Void kindly replied, "Their understanding was shallow, and minds
unsteady. Yet you are different. I can see that you have the potential to
comprehend the Buddha's wisdom." The young disciple, feeling proud,
happily followed his master back with the kasaya.

Not long after, another frozen corpse appeared outside the temple gate. As
Non-Void led his new disciple past it, the young disciple asked, "Master,
did these seniors all freeze to death?"

Non-Void continued walking slowly and said, "Fear not, my disciple. They
lacked piety and wisdom, but you are different..."

![Frozen Corpse](/image-20240827003255586.png)

## Yaksha Patroller

> In the mountains high above, a fiend blocks the way,
> With a hideous visage, and a crooked blade in sway.
> As the wind howls wildly, souls seem to fade,
> For life's last salvation, be swift and do evade.

The yakshas who migrated from the west had a great fondness for meat.
Fortunately, New Thunderclap Temple did not uphold a strict rule against
eating meat, which delighted the yakshas who sought refuge there.
All the yakshas in the mountains aspired to become Patrollers, not only
because of the uniquely designed large sword that looked particularly
imposing and could fly back to its owner with great precision, but also
because Patrollers guarded the outer mountains and always had access to
fresh meat.

One day, the yakshas gathered together, drinking blood, eating meat, and
reveling in their merriment. Their raucous behavior soon became known
throughout the temple. The Overseeing Monks, who adhered to ascetic
practices and only ate food not of flesh, were displeased. They carried a
large pot to the yakshas. When the yakshas peered into the pot, they saw
only radishes and greens, and their appetite waned.

One yaksha derided them, "Do you think eating this will help you gain a
deeper understanding of Dharma? How shallow." Another added, "Our
master said that to achieve ultimate bliss, one should not restrain one's
desires." Hearing this, the supervising monk replied, "My desire is to
promote virtue. If I cannot persuade you, I too shall be unable to achieve
ultimate bliss." Thus, both sides argued heatedly, without reaching a
conclusion.

Alas, eating what one likes and saying what one wants are not inherently
wrong. However, one's happiness should not disturb others, and one
should never derive pleasure from judging those perceived to have
transgressed. In this case, both sides were at fault.

![Yaksha Patroller](/image-20240827003834288.png)

## Yaksha Archer

> The bow's stark snap doth kindle fright,
> The arrow's tip doth chaos incite.
> Blind eyes traded for an enlightened heart,
> Fate's ear deaf to a beneficent start.

In the past, the Yaksha King was betrayed by the celestial beings, leading
to the massacre of the royal family and the downfall of the Yaksha
Kingdom. After the kingdom's collapse, the yakshas were forced into exile.
The ceremonial archers, who once guarded the royal entourage, clung to
their former glory and refused to shed their ornate armor. Despite their
exceptional archery skills, their slow shooting speed and lack of close
combat prowess made their exile particularly harsh.

Due to their inadequate strength, they resorted to ambushes from the
shadows. The abbot assigned them to the Pagoda Realm for rigorous
training. They endured daily torment there, especially when the Mani
Wheel played its beguiling chants, driving everyone mad. During these
times, the Blade Monks would seize the opportunity to behead the archers
with their large blades, leaving the yaksha archers desperate for a way to
fight back.

They sought guidance from various sources and frequently challenged the
Blade Monks, only to be defeated repeatedly. One day, some blind monks
came to oversee the Pagoda Realm. They had blinded themselves to
pursue the path to ultimate bliss, yet their martial arts were incredibly
refined. The yaksha archers asked for their advice, and the monks replied,
"Aim too carefully and you will lose the initiative. Learn from me; gouge
out your eyes, and you will shoot from the heart, never missing your
mark."

With the only other option available to them being annihilation, the
archers adopted this drastic measure, gouging out their eyes. After this,
the Blade Monks rarely targeted them. When asked why, a Blade Monk
replied, "Who would want to go up against a madman? It's safer to just
find another opponent."

![Yaksha Archer](/image-20240827004316367.png)

## Starved Abomination

> Abominations do roam the frosty, chilling path,
> With swollen rumbling bellies, necks adorned in wrath.
> They spread their malice freely, cunning and so sly,
> A fearsome presence to behold, loathsome to the eye.

In the past, at the foot of the New West, there was a village called
Changuang. In this village lived a young man who had pledged his life to a
childhood sweetheart, giving her a white jade pendant as a token of their
love, and vowing to propose once he had become successful.
The young man was a peddler, making a living by trading grain in the
surrounding areas. One day, a luxurious ferry sailed down the river near
the village, more splendid than anything the villagers had ever seen. At the
bow stood a plump monk in a yellow robe, radiating golden light. The
villagers believed he must have been enlightened.

After the arrival of the ferry, the temple in the mountains grew larger and
larger, and the young man's grain trade flourished.

One day, the young man went to trade grain and did not return for over a
month. The girl, worried, inquired about the temple's location and went
there to find him. When the young man finally returned to the village,
they missed each other, and the girl disappeared.

The young man gathered some brave villagers to search for her in the
mountains. They found no trace of her but came across a towering pagoda
by the riverbank. The young man led them there to rest.

As they approached the pagoda, the door suddenly opened. Curious,
someone peeked inside and screamed. Behind the door was a dungeon
extending deep underground, seemingly holding many people. The
villagers, filled with righteous anger, stormed into the pagoda. After a few
steps, they heard a loud bang, and the door vanished. Strange-looking
yaoguais with scythes and huge bellies emerged from the prison, laughing
wickedly.

One of them threw a bag of silvers to the young man and then eagerly
leapt forward, swinging his scythe and cutting the nearest villagers into
pieces. Realizing they had been deceived by the young man, the villagers
fled deeper into the prison. The young man watched them and
murmured, "Having lost my love, I cannot afford to lose my wealth."

![Starved Abomination](/image-20240827005023439.png)

## Red-Haired Yaksha

> With sword in hand, the foe's chest pierced,
> Blood-soaked hair, in battle fierce.
> Endless sorrow for a fallen land,
> East wind sighs, as west winds stand.

In the Kingdom of Yaksha, there were eight great generals, one of whom
was named Mi Yan. He had once practiced under the Golden Summit
Immortal at the Yuzhen Temple, located at the foot of Mount Lingshan.
Having fought countless battles, he possessed the valor of a warrior who
could face ten thousand enemies.

When a formidable enemy attacked, the Yaksha King appointed Mi Yan as
the vanguard general. Mi Yan set up a large camp at the border and
addressed his soldiers: "If any of you fear battle, walk away now, and I
won't hold it against you. But know that if we lose this foothold, the
kingdom will fall. Our elders, children, and all our wealth will become the
property of our enemies." With these words, he and the entire army swore
a blood oath to advance and never retreat.

The Yaksha army, isolated and outnumbered, faced an enemy surrounding
them on all sides, their banners blotting out the sky. Wave after wave of
enemy forces attacked relentlessly. Mi Yan and his troops fought fiercely,
suffering heavy casualties. Ultimately, Mi Yan was surrounded by
numerous Arhats and was beheaded.

The soldiers, countless among them having sacrificed their lives, retrieved
their general's head. Placing Mi Yan's head in his coffin, they witnessed his
body slowly sit up and lament. "If we lose our homeland. what difference
does it make whether I have a head or not?"

With these words, he closed his eyes and fell back down, finally passing
away as blood gushed from his neck, staining his hair red. Later, his
subordinates, in a display of loyalty and bravery, poured the blood of their
enemies over their heads, emulating Mi Yan. Despite their valor, the
Kingdom of Yaksha was ultimately destroyed, but not a single soldier from
Mi Yan's army deserted.

## Lantern Warden

> Ancient temple trees reach high,
> In dungeon shadows, life's threads lie.
> In darkness, light appears,
> Most vivid at the abyss near.

The ancient temple on the mountain peak, weathered by the passage of
time, had gradually fallen into disrepair. When the abbot returned after
many years and saw the temple in such a state of ruin, he was filled with
sorrow. Determined to restore the temple to its former glory, he spent a
large amount of gold and silver to fund it reconstruction, hoping to
showcase his path to the ultimate bliss.

The abbot selected a towering forest in the mountains, intending to use
the ancient trees there as beams for the new temple. The craftsmen
responsible for the timber set up their shelters at the edge of the forest and
began felling trees according to the abbot's instructions.

Everything proceeded smoothly, and within half a year, all the necessary
timber was prepared. The craftsmen received their wages and packed up,
ready to descend the mountain the next day.

That night, a craftsman on night watch was patrolling the area, carrying a
lantern. Suddenly, rustling sounds from the forest set his nerves on edge.
Terrified, he woke everyone up. With their lanterns lit, and axes in hand,
all the craftsmen treaded into the forest to locate the source of the sound.
As they ventured deeper into the forest, someone let out a scream and was
abruptly dragged into the darkness along with his lantern by an unknown
force. Then, one by one, despite their attempts to hide and flee, all
craftsmen were all dragged away. Only one clever craftsman quickly
extinguished his lantern. Trembling with fear, he groped his way through
the forest. Fortunately, a faint light appeared in the distance—the sun was
about to rise.

With this faint light, he found his way back and hurried towards the
shelters. As he reached the edge of the forest, the sunlight suddenly
became blindingly bright, filling his eyes with a white glare. Enduring the
pain, he looked closer and realized the light was not from the rising sun
but from his companions' lanterns. These lanterns were held up by vines
that had replaced his companions' heads, propping up their corpses.
A chubby boy with a pale face, dressed in a yellow robe, rode a tall four-
legged beast whose head emitted strange sounds. Just as the craftsman
was about to plead for mercy, he felt a chill on his back. Then, he felt
himself being lifted higher and higher until he was level with the lanterns.
The chubby child patted the beast's head, the sounds ceased, the lanterns
went out, and the night returned to its eerie stillness.

The chubby boy laughed and said, "Good materials should be used to their
fullest."

## Enslaved Yaksha

> Oh, true kindness, how pure and bright!
> Yet karma binds in debts of blight.
> With halberd in hand, I fear their gaze,
> From humble roots, my sorrow stays.

In the northwest borderlands of the Kingdom of Yuetuo, there was a small
village where an elderly couple had been childless for many years. One
day, the old man went into the mountains to chop wood and discovered a
young child under an ancient tree. The child's skin was dark and his
appearance frightening, quite different from the village children. Seeing
his frail limbs and body covered in scars, the old man assumed he was a
refugee and brought him home.

The old woman also found the child unusual and initially wanted to send
him away. However, after washing, dressing, and feeding him, she
couldn't help but feel some affection for him. After some discussion, the
couple decided to keep him.

At first, the couple treated the child very well. But within half a year, due
to his strange appearance, the villagers began to gossip and called him
"Ugly Slave." The old couple, feeling ashamed, also started to treat him
less kindly and even called him the same way as the villagers did. Within
two years, his skin turned a dark green, and the couple made him wear
thick clothes to cover his entire body, forbidding him to take them off
even in the scorching heat.

Three years later, the Ugly Slave grew more robust, and horns began to
sprout from his head. The old man, increasingly fearful, confined him to
the woodshed. Whenever he was angry, he would enter and whip the
child, sometimes even using a hatchet to cut off his horns, leaving him
covered in blood. The old woman, disgusted by the sight, blamed
everything on the child. She would beat him when upset and even burn
him with fire when she felt ashamed. The Ugly Slave endured this torment
in the woodshed for another five years.

One day, a group of wandering yakshas passed by and heard curses in the
yaksha tongue coming from the woodshed. They broke in and found their
tormented kin. They gave the Ugly Slave a long halberd, and in his fury, he
stormed into the house and repaid the old couple for all they had done to
him.

Years later, the Ugly Slave's resentment still simmers, and only by
tormenting his prey can he find any semblance of joy.

## Falcon Fan-Maker

> The swan soars high, its plumage lush and grand,
> The sparrow flits low, with feathers light and bland.
> The noble cherish wings, not swayed by gain or loss,
> The wise foresee afar, their strength endures across.
> Feathered birds are masters of riding the wind. Among them, the
> gyrfalcons living on the snowy peaks are particularly skilled in crafting
> magical items that control frigid gales. They use their down feathers to
> create fans, which are highly prized by the Wind-Making Mother Deity
> and Cloud-Making Boy Deity.

According to their clan rules, every gyrfalcon must learn the art of crafting
these vessels. Those who refuse are stripped of their titles and exiled from
the clan. To encourage innovation, the clan holds an annual competition
where the quality of vessels produced determines one's status within the
clan. One gyrfalcon, whose ancestors were all commoners, dreamt of
creating a treasure fan to elevate his status to nobility.

He spared no feathers to enhance the power of his vessel. After much
hardship, he finally crafted a fan and won the competition, becoming the
clan leader. However, he had plucked all his feathers and could no longer
fly, eventually resorting to wearing clothes to cover his baldness.

On the day of his succession, the Celestial Crane Immortal, head of the
feathered tribe in the upper realm, came to bestow a Celestial Registry
Tablet upon him. Proud of his fan, the new leader boasted to the Crane
Immortal. The Crane Immortal then lent him the Plantain Fan, saying,
"This is a failed creation of Lord Lao. Since you also make fans, I gift it to
you." After the Crane Immortal left, the clan leader tried the fan and was
immediately disheartened by its immense power. He no longer wanted his
clan members to use their feathers to make fans.

He led his followers away from the snowy peaks to search for plantain
leaves. Eventually, they found some near the New West and, imitating the
Crane Immortal's method, created many replicas, and regained his ability
to fly.

## Wolf Guardian

> The wolf's heart was once kind and sound,
> Misled, however, consumed by desire.
> The path to return was once easily found,
> Yet fate was sealed by the words of a liar.

There was a year when a young wolf followed a grey elder wolf to learn
the art of hunting. The master taught him that a great hunter strikes
swiftly and surely, sparing their prey from suffering. The young wolf
pondered this long and hard. After years of training, he devised his own
killing technique. He thought his master would be pleased with his
progress, but instead, the elder wolf scolded him for disrupting the circle
of karma and told him to repent. The young wolf's mind swam with
confusion at his master's seeming contradiction.

And so, the young wolf left Black Wind Mountain and wandered the
lands. On his travels, he heard folks whisper that wolves, though hardy
and loyal to each other, were brutal, vicious, and treacherous. The wolf
guai grew more perplexed. It seemed his years of training went against the
ways of the world.

One day, as he passed through the New West, he heard tales of a dharma
of ecstasy in that place that could free a troubled mind. He sought an
audience with the abbot.

The abbot was a chubby monk in yellow robes who loved to change form.
He heard out the wolf guai's woes and counselled, ""Wolves are born to
hunt, to slay. It is the way of your kind. Men are not the same; they are
born to plough and plant, to reap and sow. Frail and feeble, such is their
lot. They seek to leash you wolves with false pre-empts, for they hope to
escape your fangs and claws. But heed me, wolf: each kind must follow the
call of their blood, the song of their soul. Why should you bow to the
mewling of men?."

These words lit up the wolf guai's mind. At that moment, he knew his path
lay within the halls of New Thunderclap Temple, where he would walk
the road to ecstasy. The chubby monk laughed, "In my temple, we bow to
none save our own hearts. Beware, for those who fear death have no place
here." The wolf guai gladly accepted and became the monk's most loyal
guardian. Armed with a scythe, he is now bound by no code save his own
savage joy. Heed not a word from his tongue.

## Turtle Treasure

> The human heart swings good and ill,
> With wealth and treasure, freedom's thrill.
> Riding a hammer to the sky,
> Tell me, is it strange or nigh?

Years ago, in Village of Chen, a villager went out one day and saw a
peculiar man standing by the roadside, holding a rope tied to a white soft-
shelled turtle. Passers-by came and went, but no one paid any attention to
this strange sight.

The villager pretended not to notice and tried to hurry past, but the white
turtle at his feet let out a pitiful cry. In his compassion, he argued with the
peculiar man and eventually bought the white turtle, releasing it back into
the water.

That night, the villager had a dream in which the white turtle vomited out
a tiny person with blue-purple skin and an ugly face. The tiny person ran
towards the villager, startling him awake.

After that, the villager began to change. His eyes could see occasional
glimmers of light in the mountains and fields, and his appetite grew
immensely, along with his strength. One day, he took a shovel and dug
into the ground, discovering a coffin filled with valuable artifacts. This
unexpected found bestowed hiss great wealth.

One night, the white turtle appeared in his dream again, letting out a cry.
The villager felt his stomach churn and vomited out the tiny person with
blue-purple skin. The tiny person fell to the ground and hurried towards
the white turtle. Realizing something, the villager grabbed the tiny person
and swallowed him back down. The white turtle called out a few more
times, but the villager covered his mouth, refusing to let the tiny person
out. After a tense stand-off, the villager woke up again.

Over time, the villager's appearance became increasingly abnormal,
forcing him to wear an iron mask to hide his face. Eventually, even his skin
turned blue-purple, and he fled into the mountains, carrying specially
made tools to search for more treasures.

Interestingly, on his treasure-hunting journey, he discovered that he was
not the only one with such an experience, which brought him some
comfort.

## Thunder Rhino Master

> Green pines hold the lingering snow,
> Emerald flames guard the dim light's glow.
> Wandering beyond that sacred hill,
> True nature lies in temperance's will.

Along with the fall of the Yaksha Kingdom, the Rakshasa Kingdom, due to
their kinship with the yakshas, also met its end.

Thunder Rhino Masters was a descendant of the Rakshasas. Among his
relatives, many followed Princess Rakshasi. After her eastward migration,
Rakshasi had a new Daoist master in the Celestial Court. Practicing Daoism
in Buddhism's stead, Rakshasi marked a departure from her past. Thunder
Rhino Masters, unwilling to accept this change, heard that a branch of the
Yakshas was seeking Buddhist teachings in the New West and decided to
come here.

Unlike the Yakshas' free-spirited practice, Thunder Rhino Masters, though
an outer disciple, held their master in high regard and strictly adhered to
the temple's rules. Reaching the ultimate bliss was not their ultimate goal;
it was simply their nature to strive with all their efforts in everything they
do. Even when guarding the temple, they were relentless. If anyone
disturbed the temple's peace, the lightning they summon would pursue
and strike without mercy. Such individuals could sometimes inspire
admiration, but they could also be quite troublesome.

## Dark-faced Overlord

> Majestic stands the mountain's frame,
> Its golden peak, an enlightening flame.
> Winds and clouds by will are swayed,
> Heart remains clear, night and day.

The grand hall was filled with pious devotees attending the ceremony.
This was the fourth ceremony organized by Yellowbrow for his mortal
believers.

A devotee had attended three times, witnessing numerous miracles on
each occasion. However, it was the first time for his acquaintance from
their hometown to attend such a ceremony, and the acquaintance
harbored deep suspicions.

Before long, two blind monks carried in a statue of a Wrathful Vajra. The
devotee introduced it to his acquaintance, saying, "This Vajra can discern
a person's goodness or evil."

As he finished speaking, two men approached the statue, accusing each
other over some grievances. In no time, they were reduced to ashes by the
Vajra.

The acquaintance was shocked by the abruptness of it all. Just then, he
heard heavy footsteps outside the hall. Looking out through the window,
he saw a giant with blue skin, draped in a golden spiked robe, walking
slowly towards them.

The devotee introduced again, "This guardian can judge a person's
sincerity." After saying this, the monks led the crowd to present their
offerings to the guardian one by one. He reminded, "Make sure to give
away all your money.'

The acquaintance, deeply distrustful of the devotee's words, said, "You've
been deceived by them. These monks are all frauds."
The devotee retorted angrily, "How can you speak so recklessly? Why
Would I deceive you, being from the same hometown?"
"Who knows if you're in cahoots with them?""
Their argument grew louder and louder. The Vajra, seeing their quarrel,
raised its steel fork and charged at them.

The acquaintance quickly fled, but the devotee shouted, "Don't be afraid,
I will prove my sincerity!" The Vajra showed no hesitance.
Just when the acquaintance thought his fellow townsman was doomed,
the blue-skinned giant raised his hand to block the Vajra, saving the
devotee's life.

From then on, the acquiantance became a regular at the ceremonies,
always making sure to give away all his money before leaving, just like his
fellow townsman.

## Clay Vajra

> With an iron trident, a wrathful Vajra stands,
> Angry eyes blazing, a fiery fearsome brand.
> All beings bear their sins, for that is what they say,
> Burn them, guilty all, for peace to truly stay.

The Buddhist scriptures describe the Vajra as a guardian warrior of the
Buddha, tasked with upholding justice and eradicating sin.
Since the fat monk in yellow took back the New Thunderclap Temple,
magnificent new pavilions and pagodas were built to hold gatherings of
his devotees and attract more believers.

During one such gathering, two devotees met for the first time in the main
hall. Upon seeing each other, they immediately felt a surge of suspicion
and wariness. At that moment, the abbot had a statue of a Vajra carried in.
The statue stood on four legs, wielding a steel trident, with a wrathful
expression, but it had a peculiar hole in its chest.

The abbot introduced the statue, explaining that it was newly crafted and
imbued with a particular spiritual power that could discern right from
Wrong. One of the devotees hurried to the Vajra and said, "May the Vajra
eradicate all deceitful swindlers in the world and grant me justice." This
man was known for being gullible and often fell victim to ruses, yet he
never dared to seek retribution.

The other devotee quickly followed, saying, "May the Vajra eradicate
those who gain unfair advantages and then complain incessantly, granting
me peace." This man was a dishonest merchant who frequently sold
substandard goods and was often persecuted and cursed by his customers.

Hearing each other's wishes, the two began to argue fiercely in front of the
statue. The Vajra's eyes suddenly moved, and with a swift motion of its
trident, it killed both men. Flames then erupted from its four legs,
incinerating their bodies completely.
News of this event spread quickly, shocking the folks around the temple.
Some accused the abbot of using sorcery to deceive people, while others
praised his profound Buddhist wisdom and extraordinary powers.
Regardless, no one dared to disrespect him.

## Golden Lotus Guai

> Auspicious clouds above, unaware of worldly strife,
> Descendants scattered far, seeking out a better life.

Ancient texts state that whenever Bodhisattvas or Buddhas manifested
their divine presence, golden lotuses bloomed from the earth, radiating
brilliance.

As time passed, these golden lotuses grew increasingly discontent. They
saw the rat of Mount Lingshan, who became a king by stealing lamp oil;
the carp of the Southern Sea, who became a great lord by stealing
Guanyin's lotus flowers; and even the scorpion that stung the Buddha,
gaining the power and became a powerful yaoguai. In contrast, despite
their diligent service, the golden lotuses received nothing.

After careful consideration, they decided to entrust the burden of
greatness to their descendants. They scattered their seeds across the
mortal realm, hoping they would become yaoguais of power and
eventually earn a title in the upper realm.

However, the golden lotuses did not anticipate the path to greatness to be
that arduous in the mortal world. With many intelligent and brave mortal
beings also seeking enlightenment, the competition was fierce and brutal.
The golden lotuses then tried various methods: transforming into women
to deceive men and steal their vital essence, only to be recognized and
slain by Daoists; transforming into old men to use their wits to deceive and
devour scholars, only to be seen through and mocked. Such attempts
were numerous and often futile.

Trials and tribulations made the golden lotuses gradually realized that
their original form, the auspicious flowers indicating the Buddhas's
presence, had a better chance of success. Hence, they went to the temples,
using the auspiciousness to lure people into picking them, only to devour
them afterward.

Alas, if one seeks to perceive the world solely in pursuit of quick success,
how complex the world becomes! Cause and effect are intertwined, and
fate is mysterious. Every step taken is predestined.

![Golden Lotus Guai](/image-20240827013653826.png)

## Wushan Lesser Guai

> Gaping mouth, round belly, born incomplete,
> Bulky form, craving and chasing tasty treats.
> Greedy for flavors, it longs for delight,
> Wagging its tongue, it speaks in spite.

One spring, the Webbed Hollow hosted a grand banquet to mark the
blossoming of the flowers. A young guai from Mount Wushan, having
presented the gift, saw the ladies chatting and laughing at the feast and
decided to join the other guais in the cave for drinks and merriment.

A few cups in, the guais began to jest with each other. A pig guai remarked,
"1'd rather live in this rich cave of yours, with banquets for every season
and festival. Back in our place, the Lady is too strict to allow any fun."

A proud insect guai responded, "Our ladies in the cave often host
banquets to keep the mistress company. We may not compare to the halls
of the Celestial Court, but our second lady has some businesses in the
mortal world, so we're not short on silver. It's tough, though; if she didn't
find ways to bring in money, we wouldn't have made it this far."

Another pig guai added, "Beautiful and elegant are all your ladies. I
wonder which celestial mountain is fortunate enough to be where they
might start their new families."

The insect guai laughed, "Our ladies can't leave this place. The businesses
outside are managed by carefully chosen people. Since we only take
bridegrooms who marry into the family, the talented ones don't want to
come, and the ladies don't fancy those who do. Look over there, those
four scorpions; their family is in decline, and their descendants are
unworthy. Only one is somewhat acceptable, but not one of our ladies
would marry him. Whoever gets unlucky will marry him on a fateful day,
so they say."

The guais laughed heartily, enjoying themselves, when suddenly there
was a shout, "Oh no! The ladies are quarreling!"
A panting pig guai in charge ran over, shouting, "The mistress in the cave
has lost her mind. She got into a fight with our Lady over a few words from
a maid and even smashed the very gift that was brought."

The guais were all startled. The clever ones quickly wrapped some food in
lotus leaves and handed it to the pig guais as an apology,"Next time, we'll
make sure there's no misunderstanding. Sorry for spoiling the fun."
"All right, all right! The pig guais took the food and hurriedly followed
the steward out, asking, "What exactly happened?""
"Who knows? It's all too odd. Every time we come, there's a commotion.
I've heard their mistress is always quite muddle-headed..."

## Puppet Spider

> Bad nose, crooked mouth, sharp fangs, poisonous and thick.
> Check the ears, cut the forehead, and the face has eight eyes and ugly
> appearance.

Long ago, a woodcutter lived deep in the hills. One day, he went down to
the market fair and saw a puppet show. He loved it and yearned to see it
again.

One day, as he cut wood, he heard shouts of glee in the mountains. He
followed the sounds and saw a mob of yaoguais reveling together. Despite
his fear, curiosity urged him to climb a rock to watch them from afar. The
guais were gathered in a circle, watching an acrobat show. Too far to see
well, the woodcutter could only discern a red-clad guai whirling twin
blades in dazzling spins and flips.

Entranced, the woodcutter crept closer. He saw the acrobatic guai had
legs tied behind its back, strings dangling from its feet. In a flash, he knew
it was a puppetry trick. He climbed a large tree for a clearer view.

The guai had an ugly, comical face. To the woodcutter, this spectacle was
even more amusing than the finest plays at the market fair. He watched,
spellbound. A chill on his neck jolted him out of the reverie. Reaching up
to check, he found his fingers coated in green spittle. Looking up in
horror, he was greeted by a myriad of eyes staring down at him. There, in
the treetop, dangled a violet spider, its legs threaded with silk, tugging the
distant puppet guai to and fro.

The woodcutter yelped and fell from the tree. At that, the spider paused,
and the gathering of yaoguais turned as one to glare at him. Stricken with
terror, the woodcutter fled and, upon returning home, fell gravely ill. No
remedy could ease his suffering. He wasted away and soon died.

## Puppet Tick

> Can you discern the outer guise?
> Who cares when hidden from our eyes?
> When hung up high, what use retains?
> A puppet's dance, its fleeting gains.

Tales told of Zhu's Estate in Webbed Ridge, the ancestral home of the
wealthy textile family in the Kingdom of Zhuzi. Rumors claimed the estate
housed vast amounts of gold and jewels, but those riches were never
found.

In the Kingdom of Zhuzi lived two thieves who called each other brothers.
The elder, a broad and forthright soul; the younger, a handsome and
clever spirit. Fleeing a warrant, they sought Zhu's Estate in the mountains
as their next target as well as a hideout. For days, they scoured the hills,
their rations spent, and their hope lost. Weary and famished, they
chanced upon a tea hut. The young thief called out, "Let's rest there,
brother!" The elder replied, "We've seen no one for days; how could there
be a tea hut?" But driven by hunger, the young one hastened toward it.

The elder chased after him, pleading. They tussled until they entered the
hut. Crude and dirty, it had rough log tables and stone stools. There were
no patrons inside, only a hunchbacked old man with a cane brewing tea.
The young thief asked, "How do you sell tea here with no one around, old
man?" The old man pointed to a dim village behind the hut. "This humble
one lives in the hilltop village. This hut serves but to eke out my living." He
then served two bowls of thick, strange-smelling brew. The young thief
reached for one, but the elder stopped him and asked the old man, "Do
you know of Zhu's Estate?" The old man grinned, ""It lies within the
village. Drink your tea, and I shall guide you there."" The young thief
beamed, but the elder grew warier. He snatched the bowl from the young
one. "I shall try it first." With that, he downed it in one gulp.

No sooner had the tea hit his belly than he collapsed, writhing in agony.
The young thief turned to the old man, only to witness his true form
revealed as a hunchbacked, cane-wielding creature, its body entangled in
silk. Lifting his eyes, he saw a colossal spider perched in the rafters,
tugging the strands to prompt the bug to tap its cane with a resonant
"ting-ting." At this signal, the stone stools shifted and unfurled their legs.
They became little stone spiders. They spat silk at the elder thief to
entangle him. At this sight, the younger thief turned and fled, as if he had
not heard his brother's pleas for help.

## Lantern Holder

> When night falls deep, his light shines down,
> Summoned is the Yin, suppressed is the Yang.
> Like harvesters hastening before the dawn,
> He reaps with his blade, and souls are gone.

The insect guais loathed patrolling after dusk, as their instinct to chase
after light made the nighttime perilous for them. But luck favored them
when a tribe of pale-faced yakshas from the west of the place, having
traversed the world, chose to settle at the Webbed Ridge and volunteered
for the night watch, a task the insect guais were only too happy to
relinquish to these newcomers.

The yakshas are proud and fierce by nature. Turned into feral yaoguais, yet
they still clung to their old ways in the days they were revered. They kept
to their own, with lanterns lit from dusk to dawn, and rarely mingled with
the insect guais. To the latter, they were a curious sight with their
merriment and banter that paid no heed to hierarchy or status. Yet, what
puzzled the insect guais most was the yakshas' bond; close-knit in joy, yet
they'd often erupt into disputes and hurl sharp words with no restraint.

One night, a quarrel broke out during an idle chatter among four yakshas
on patrol, and their raucous noise woke the insect guais. "Why must you
carry on as this?" the insect guais rushed to mediate, persuading them.
"Arguing one moment, chummy the next. Why not treat each other with
proper respect, like we do?""

In an instant, the quarrel ceased, and in unison, the yakshas retorted, "You
are mistaken," one spat. "Only through open discourse, we grow."
Another chimed in, "Exactly, when we air out our disagreements, it only
makes our bond stronger." A third added, "Indeed. By having each other's
backs, we've made it through a lot of tough times. Our harsh words don't
mean any harm." The last concluded, "Unlike you insect guais, we hide no
secret grievances under the guise of harmony." With that, arm in arm,
they departed, leaving the insect guais to dismiss the exchange with
bemused eye rolls.

## Grasshopper Guai

> Slender legs, a verdant sheen,
> Each arm wields a sickle keen.
> Misty woods are his home so true,
> He cares for youth, like me and you.

During the reign of the greatest emperor of Han, there was a village called
Bath. From within its mountains, a hot spring flowed, reputed to preserve
youth and vitality. Nobles flocked to it from far and wide.
One day, the Marquis of Lecheng came to visit with his six-year-old son.
The young lord caught a little grasshopper and wanted to keep it as a pet,
so he tore off its wings and trapped it in a teacup.

That night, the Marquis was visited in his dreams by a man clad in green.
"Your child has imprisoned mine," he pleaded. "We are both fathers. I
beseech you, help my little one."

The next morning, the Marquis summoned his son and inquired about
what happened. The boy, who feared his stern father, only provided vague
replies. Thus, the full story remained elusive to both. That night, the
green-clad man revisited the Marquis' dreams, with twin swords at his
waist. He warned, "If you don't return my son, you'll never see yours
again." The Marquis woke with a start and rushed to his son's bed, only to
find it empty. Servants scoured the village but found no trace.
Only the young lord's page remembered the bug-catching. He rushed to
the study, found the overturned teacup, and gently released the
grasshopper onto the grass.

By noon, the young lord returned home safely, yet his hands were red and
swollen, and he couldn't stop weeping. When questioned about the
events of the previous night, he sobbed, "1 dreamt ofa man in green, a
great jumper. He carried me on his back and hopped a few times. Then, I
didn't know where I was. He scolded me for harming others and struck
my palms with his swords twenty times." When asked how he came back,
he was unable to answer, overwhelmed by fear.

Alas, it is said that all beings love their young, a truth that spans the world.
Even yaoguais, it seems, are no different.

In the late years of the Han, the hot spring in Bath suddenly dried up.
Insect guais sprouted in the hills, so the villagers moved down the
mountain. A decade or two later, the area came to be known as the
Webbed Ridge.

![Grasshopper Guai](/image-20240827215951385.png)

## Dragonfly Guai

> Fly through the flowers and willows to shoot hidden arrows, flap your
> wings and ride the crooked wind.
> It is difficult to achieve good deeds with small wisdom, and twos and
> threes block the way.

There was a dragonfly guai who loved archery. His mother saw his gift and
used her connections for an opportunity to have him training under the
Yaoguai King of the land.

To the King, the dragonfly guai seemed like a diligent and talented
student. He drilled hard each day and served his master with great
respect, always at his master's beck and call. At times, he'd be practicing
outside, but at a single command from his teacher, he'd appear at once.
The King had doubts, but considering the dragonfly's swift wings, the
King dismissed his suspicions.

One day, the King taught him how to imbue his bolts with greater power.
"Wait for the arrowhead to glow, then release." The guai swore he'd
remember, but when tested that afternoon, he couldn't recall anything.
The King assumed he just hadn't grasped the lesson and explained it once
more. But the next day, he'd had forgotten it again.

This pattern continued. The Yaoguai King flew into a rage and set to
punish the guai. The guai fell to his knees and pleaded. "Mercy, master! I
have brothers. Each of us knows only a portion of the lessons. That's why I
can't answer." At this, scores of identical dragonfly guais emerged, all
kneeling and bowing non-stop. Offended yet tickled by this revelation, the
King demoted them all to lowly patrol guards and taught them no more.
Alas, while petty schemes might seem perfect at first, earning praise and
favor, they also sow the seeds of trouble. When the truth is revealed, one
faces ridicule and brings ruin upon themselves.

## Wasp Guai

> When the victory comes, it flies low, and when the power is exhausted, it
> flees far away.
> Work hard and wash away the dye, and use the power to soar into the sky.

A young man once lived in the Webbed Hollow. You may wonder how he
found himself living among the yaoguais. The tale begun in the Kingdom
of Zhuzi, where he was born into a family of weavers, their craft passed
down through generations. One day, his father left home in search of a
jade shuttle but never returned. His mother searched for him, only to be
told he had abandoned them to marry into the Zhu family. Consumed by
grief and convinced that a yaoguai had ensnared her husband, she wept
day after day. Thus, in his boyhood, the son vowed to slay the yaoguais and
avenge his father.

Years later, he heard merchants speak of the Zhu's Estate on the Webbed
Ridge, home to women of unearthly beauty. He ventured there alone to
exact vengeance. But as soon as he entered the mountains, lesser yaoguais
captured him. Terrified he was, before a little girl in yellow rescued him by
commanding the yaoguais to stop. The girl, barely ten, had a sweet, rosy
face-hardly an evil yaoguai as he imagined. The young man was at a loss.
To his surprise, the young girl, lonely with few companions her age,
brought him to the Webbed Hollow to play. He stayed, and she visited
often to lift her spirits. Conflicted, he spent nights vowing by lamplight to
slay the yaoguais and avenge his father come morning. One night, a small
wasp flew in and heard his oath, but he paid it no mind.

The next day, the girl didn't come. Instead, a woman in green, adorned
with an elaborate bun and possessing a fierce yet beautiful face, arrived
with an entourage of insect guards. Among them was a wasp yaoguai who,
with practiced ease, deftly searched the young man's trunk, pulling out
his hidden stash of travel money and the dagger intended for murder
hidden within his porcelain pillow, before relaying his nightly vow of
vengeance to its mistress.

The green-clad woman addressed the young man, "No mortal shall reside
in Webbed Hollow, yet we spared you to be a companion for my younger
sister. But, in return, you plot to harm her, and you shall be punished for
this. That being said, your quest for vengeance is understandable; which is
why I shall leave your fate to the Bonevault." At her command, the guards
seized him, casting him into the abyss, his fate uncertain in the darkness
below.

## Beetle Captain

> Summer turns to winter, spring returns to autumn, my body is wasting  
> time and gradually becoming old and ugly.  
> I know that my white hair has been exchanged for fame, and my stubborn  
> and arrogant character has burdened your life.

Unlike the bee, wasp, hornet, katydid, cockroach, grasshopper, and
dragonfly-the adopted sons of the spider ladies, the beetle captain earned
his rank through his own valor. Perhaps this was what made him stubborn,
quick to anger over slights to his status. He often quarreled with the lesser
guais over matters of words and etiquette. They called him arrogant and
overbearing behind his back, disliking him all the more.

One day, a petty dispute drove him to brandish his twin sabers at the lesser
guards. The beetle commander chanced by and pulled him aside, "You
think your deeds and skills command their respect. But, know this, rank
has no bearing on the actions of others. What would happen if you
measured your worth by the regard of everyone? When stone spiders
show you disrespect, you'd think that makes you their inferior."

The captain retorted, "You're a commander, thus none dare offend you.
But I'm a minor officer. If I don't assert myself, those lesser ones will scorn
me even more."

The commander shook his head, "1f they treated you with greater
deference than me, would that make you my superior in practice and skill?
Nay, for I have observed that those who clamor most for respect often
receive the least of it."

What became of the beetle captain? Alas, he remained as he ever was, as
one's nature could not be easily altered. It was said that he continued to
contend with all who crossed his path until at last, he was never to be seen
again.

![Beetle Captain](/image-20240827220047501.png)

## Stone Spider

> Small and humble, a spider I be;
> Yet in stone I adorn, with comrades in peril beside me.

In the olden days, a lesser beetle guai in the Webbed Hollow rose to the
rank of captain through sheer prowess. But the promotion swelled his ego,
and he lorded it over the others till they shunned him, much to his ire.
Upon a day of rest, the beetle captain found himself bereft of friends to
squander the hours with and thus roamed the cave alone. He beheld a
stone from which long and slender legs sprouted forth. As it turned out,
the stone held a spider stirring from slumber.

These spiders, burdened with stones upon their backs, moved in a slow,
clumsy manner. The captain, beset by a foul mood, kicked one over and
laughed at its plight as it flailed and struggled to right itself. With each
attempt it made to stand, he flicked it down again, guffawing.

After who knows how long, crisp raps echoed from the depths of the cave.
Soon, hordes of stone spiders marched out of the dark. Seeing the threat,
the captain drew his weapons and charged into their midst. The spiders
showed no fear; they hurled stones, spat silk and venom, rammed and
butted. They drove the captain into a rage, and he spun his twin blades in a
killing frenzy amidst the spiders. As he cut them down with zeal, a flicker
of lantern light neared, followed by a playful voice, "You fool, you think
you can slay every spider in the Webbed Hollow alone? Come with me-I'll
take you to play under the peach blossoms."

The beetle captain lifted his gaze to behold a maiden of unsurpassed
beauty. His heart stirred, and he followed her at once. Henceforth, he was
seen no more. One old guai mused, "To slay spiders within their lair is but
to seek death itself."

![Stone Spider](/image-20240827220102063.png)

## Minor Amourworm

> In foreign lands, it toils and spins,
> Weaving cocoons, its work begins.
> Unable to transform and soar,
> It falls into the net once more.
> From the southern slopes of Mount Huai, one can gaze upon the radiant
> splendor of Mount Kunlun, its brilliance stretching for miles, exuding an
> awe-inspiring grandeur.

On Mount Kunlun, there exists a creature called the "Tuluo." It resembles
a sheep but has four horns and is known to devour humans. Another
creature, known as the "Qinyuan," looks like a bee but is as large as a
mandarin duck. Its sting is lethal to birds and beasts, and it can wither
trees with a mere touch of its venom.

King Mu of Zhou once had the fortune to visit Mount Kunlun. He toured
its magnificent palaces, tasted various celestial herbs and delicacies,
listened to sweet music performed by beautiful celestial maidens, and saw
many wondrous mythical beasts.

When the celestial maidens presented gifts to King Mu, he refused but
pointed to the mythical beasts in garden and asked, "May I take one of
these extraordinary creatures back with me?" The celestial maidens
replied, "The beings of Kunlun drink from the celestial moat and feed on
celestial herbs. Even if you take them to the mortal realm, they would lose
their form and abilities. It is better not to take them away, for if they
transform, we cannot predict what calamities they might cause."

![Minor Amourworm](/image-20240827220136227.png)

## Clawed Cocoon

> The world is full of hustle and bustle, how much money can you make
> from all the hustle and bustle?
> Will you be caught in the trap of heaven and earth, and be entangled by
> the thread of chance?

In the Kingdom of Zhuzi, a curious tale prevailed. No matter how many
kings came and went, the Zhu family of the Royal Weaving Office never
relocated. They wove a fabric known as Celestial Silk, gleaming as
moonlight, light as clouds. Nobility and merchants alike clamored for it.
The city's weavers seethed with jealousy, but none could replicate it. Over
time, whispers spread that the Zhus owed their skill to a jade shuttle,
bestowed by the Red-clad Immortal.

One weaver was convinced that obtaining that shuttle would also secure
his fortune. On a deep, dark night, he sneaked into the Zhu's workshop
outside the city walls during the second watch.

The Zhus were rich enough to have their workshop sprawled wide and
vast. In the dead of night, not a soul was in sight. The weaver crept
through the yards of draping silks when a pure white light fell upon the
center of the drying racks. The moon dimmed, and darkness swallowed all
but that single, shining pillar joining earth and sky.

The weaver stumbled toward it and discovered the pillar of light was made
of countless strands of silk. Two monstrous silkworms were spinning
these strands into cocoons and hanging them on the drying racks. The
cocoons' hooked feet grabbed the silk strands and passed a jade shuttle
back and forth, weaving the exquisite fabric. Dazed, the weaver became
fixated on the shuttle, convinced that owning it would endow him with
the same power. But the cocoons impaled him with their sharp hooks in a
blink of an eye. As he lay dying, he saw the worms crawling toward him.
They carried him into the pillar of light and wrapped him a luminous
cocoon.

![Clawed Cocoon](/image-20240827220153257.png)

## Scorpion Prince

> Silent it hides, with venomous claws,
> Barbed hooks laced with deadly flaws.
> It arrives with a fierce, bold show,
> But in defeat, it tucks tail and goes.

The four sons of the Scorpion House often secretly inquired about each
other's recent activities. This was not out of brotherly affection but rather
due to a competitive spirit, fearing that one of them might be chosen by
one of the sisters in the cave before the others.

Not only did they spy on each other's whereabouts, but they also felt
compelled to comment on them afterward. If they heard that a brother
had achieved something recently, they would make sarcastic remarks and
express jealousy. Conversely, if a brother had made a mistake, they would
mock and ridicule him, taking pleasure in his misfortune.

Confused by such behavior, the lesser yaoguais in the cave approached
Commander Beetle to seek an explanation.

Commander Beetle explained, "Their fear isn't about failing to marry a
lady; it's that their brother's promotion will cut into their own benefits."
Hearing this, the lesser yaoguais were even more perplexed.

Commander Beetle continued, "The Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master will
not permit the Scorpion family to amass excessive power. Thus, if one of
the four brothers ascends to the position of prince consort, the prospects
for the others inevitably wane. This principle extends to the official roles

within the cave. Take Scorpion Eldest, for instance; having gained the
favor of the Second Madam, he faces the most exclusion from his
brothers."

"But the eldest one is indeed more capable, while the others are not as
competent," one lesser yaoguai chimed in.

"Exactly. Because he has some skills, his brothers only talk behind his back
and don't dare to confront him directly. Were it someone less skilled, it
might not be the same...".

![Scorpion Prince](/image-20240827220216280.png)

## Sword Daoist

> To seek the Dao, he journeys far,
> With steadfast heart, he finds the gate.
> In the depths of sword skills,
> He glimpses roots of ascension's innate.

Every ten years, the Temple of Yellow Flowers opens its doors to recruit
disciples.

One day, a newly admitted young Daoist discovered that the disciples
focused on innate practice were divided into three different groups based
on their skills. One group used staffs, another used fly-whisks, and the
third used swords.

The young Daoist observed them closely and noticed that the disciples
who used staffs and fly-whisks were also responsible for various chores
around the temple and had less favorable living conditions. In contrast,
the disciples who used swords only needed to focus on their training and
they were even privileged to receive daily guidance from the master. The
young Daoist secretly consulted the senior disciples and found out that
the sword disciples were also the quickest to achieve enlightenment and
ascension.

However, becoming a disciple of the sword group was no easy task. It
required passing a rigorous examination by the master, and only those
deemed to have the highest potential were given the opportunity. The
young Daoist visited each senior disciple, noting down the questions the
master had asked them in the past, and made thorough preparations.
Eventually, he succeeded in his endeavor, winning first place. The master
personally tied his hair into a topknot and bestowed upon him a sword.

From the moment he joined the sword group, he woke up early every day
to train under the supervision of the Commander Beetle. In the
afternoons, he strengthened his Qi under the master's guidance. Though
the life was monotonous and arduous, he was very content.

After more than a decade of rigorous cultivation, the disciples of sword
group finally earned the master's approval.

The master informed them that their skills were now proficient enough
for them to enter the mountains for secluded meditation. If they were
fortunate enough, they could achieve their ascension.

## Fly-Whisk Daoist

> The wide robe and crane cloak flutter in the breeze,
> Why compare the righteous with the unrighteous, please?
> Praising virtues and merits disturbs the sweet dream,
> Whisking dust and sweeping earth disrupts the serene theme.

In Petalfall Hamlet lived a Daoist. He had taken his vows last and was the
youngest, and thus, the grandmaster doted on him. He, too, was glad to
wait on the grandmaster at all times. If the grandmaster extended a hand,
he served tea. If the grandmaster lifted a foot, he removed his shoe. He
swatted flies, fanned the breeze, made the bed, and tidied the covers-
quick and thorough in his duties. The grandmaster favored him greatly.

His fellow disciples burned with jealousy, but they couldn't stoop to such
fawning. They could only speak ill of him behind his back and bully him to
vent their ire.

One day, the grandmaster held a test to assess his disciples' learning.
When it was the turn of the youngest, he decided to be lenient with him.
He only asked him to recite a passage from the scripture of Dao De Jing.
The young disciple put on a smug face and chanted in a loud, clear voice:
"The Dao produced One One, produced Two Two, produced Three Three,
produced all thing....

The other disciples had long awaited this moment, and their wish was
finally granted. They roared with laughter and even stole glances at the
grandmaster to see his reaction. The grandmaster, furious, stormed off in a
huff. The other disciples then warned the young one, "You've committed
a grave blunder and incited his anger today. Don't dream of learning any
solid skills from him now."

After that incident, the grandmaster shunned the youngest disciple. But
then he found he had no one to wait on him properly. Over time, he
reminisced about the young disciple's attentiveness. Before long, the
disciple was summoned to serve him again. But when he saw the disciple's
disinterest in Daoist learning, his aversion returned. One day, the young
disciple implored the grandmaster to teach him some skills, and the
grandmaster took the fly-swatting, fan-waving motions the boy did each
day and made them into a set of moves. Who knows if it was meant as
sarcasm? In the end, he taught the boy those moves and wind-wielding
techniques, and that was all the boy could hope for.

## Staff Daoist

> Fairy mountains, clouds and waters are connected to the horizon, and
> home is nowhere to be seen.
> Holding a stick, I walk far into the dangerous nest and enjoy the white
> snow and yellow buds.

Long ago, a mountain village sat on a ridge teeming with insects. Strange
things kept happening, so the villagers all moved out, leaving it a deserted
village. In the village below lived a young man. His mother had died, and
his father was a poor wastrel who paid him no mind. The villagers looked
down on him and often abused him. He felt he couldn't endure such
disdain, so he fled to live in the abandoned village. Little did he know that
the village was claimed by a swarm of insect guais.

As soon as the young man reached the ridge, the yaoguais seized him. He
didn't fight back, as a deep-rooted death wish, stemming from a life
without attachments, had long infested his heart. Seeing his resignation,
the insects didn't harm him. Instead, they provided him shelter in a
dilapidated shack.

That night, a middle-aged Daoist brought him food and clothing. "1 heard
you have nowhere to go, so I brought you some things for daily use. If you
don't mind, take me as your master and stay here. I can teach you practices
for ascension." The youth hadn't been cared for in so long. He eagerly
donned the Daoist robe and performed the rites to acknowledge his
master. From then on, he lived and trained with the insect guais. They
spent their days dining and walking together, and at night, they slept side
by side.

One day, a scholar barged into the young man's room. "I've just escaped
from the yaoguais' lair. They had trapped me in a cocoon sack, and I'm
unsure of their intentions. I'm fleeing this place. You're human, you
should come with me." The young man shook his head. "I'm content here.
Why should I leave?" The scholar grew angry, "Because they're yaoguais
and you're human! Even if they don't harm you, staying with them long
enough will turn you into a yaoguai as wel!"

"You're right," the young man said as he grabbed his staff and knocked the
scholar to the ground. "But even if I turn into a yaoguai, I'll do so gladly."
The scholar deemed that the young man was past saving. Gritting his teeth
against the pain, he crawled out the door and fled alone.

## Snake Herbalist

> Pine, bamboo, plum grant him a blue hue,
> Yet hearts of jackals, tigers, and leopards he possesses true.
> Collecting herbs from mountains and streams,
> No desire to aid the world, lost in selfish dreams.

In the old days, there was a Daoist temple at the foot of Purple Cloud
Mountain. An ascetic Daoist nun, worn from her long travels, sought
shelter there one night. The temple nuns, moved by her devotion, offered
her hot water and fresh clothes.

As she bathed, the nun heard a sound from the rafters. Without showing
any sign of alarm, she put on her robe and nonchalantly picked up her fly.
whisk. With a gentle flick, the whisk stretched and coiled with her
motion, snaking up to the rafters and seizing a yaoguai.

Alerted by the commotion, the temple nuns rushed into the room to
investigate. On the ground crouched a snake guai with green scales,
unfazed by its capture. It seemed the nuns had been its prior victims, now
taking turns to scold it. The snake guai looked at them with contempt and
puffed out its cheeks to spew green venom in every direction. Anyone
struck by even a drop collapsed at once, writhing in pain.

As the guai had no remorse, the nun took out a wispy golden needle,
prepared to destroy it. Only then did the snake show fear. It pleaded at
once: "I'm just a lesser herbalist guai from the mountain. In my basket
outside is the antidote for them. Please, will you spare my life, immortal
lady?"

Hearing its sincere plea, the nun granted it mercy. The guai rummaged in
its basket and handed her some small white pellets. "These are the leaves
of the pearl tree. They're rare in the mortal world and can cure all
venoms." It fed one to each Daoist nun, and they recovered at once.

After that, the temple always had tree pearls on hand, and many afflicted
by venom came here to seek aid. But the high cost of a tree pearl meant
many, unable to afford it, had to face the toxin's fatal outcome.

## Snake Sheriff

> A head so large, a tail so thin, seven feet long,
> A patterned form, electric eyes, fierce and strong.
> With tiger stripes, it boasts with pride,
> Yet beneath its head, a strange guise hides.

In the mountains, there was a tiger with a strong desire for the Dao. He
traveled across high mountains and great rivers, seeking a Daoist temple to
practice. However, his Daoist affinity was thin, and he couldn't find a
master willing to accept him until he reached the Webbed Hollow, hoping
to become a disciple under an accomplished immortal.

At first, the immortal master disdained him for being a mere tiger, unlike
his other disciples, and refused to see him. The tiger knelt outside the
mountain gate for several days without rising. The immortal master,
sensing his sincerity, gave him a chance and accepted him as an outer
disciple.

Unexpectedly, the tiger had no steadfastness. After the initial fervor, he
didn't put in the effort. The immortal master advised him, "One's practice
relies on oneself, not the master." But the tiger couldn't grasp this and was
punished to guard the mountain at Forest of Ferocity. Feeling resentful,
the tiger became even lazier, spending his days lying idly under a tree and
cursing his master to pass the time.

One day, while half-asleep under the tree, complaining about his master,
he suddenly heard a soft sigh and felt something slip into his mouth.
Startled, he sat up, but there was no one around. He retched for a long

time but couldn't expel anything, thinking it was just a dream.
After some time, the tiger's neck became long and thin, and he could no
longer speak. He diligently patrolled Hollow Forest every day. People
whispered among themselves, "He started his Daoist practice with
enthusiasm but ended poorly. The master must have punished him, which
is why he looks like this now. From now on, we'd best be careful."

## Worm Practitioner

> Swallowing pills to hasten flight,
> In tainted streams, he shares the blight.
> Better to seek the straight and true,
> Than in the crooked paths pursue.

The disciples who practiced swordsmanship in the temple had been
training under their master for a long time. Since joining the group, they
had all harbored the wish to attain ascension, diligently practicing their
skills with great perseverance.

One day, the master finally informed his disciples that after years of
rigorous training, their skills had become proficient. He told them that
they could now follow him into the mountains for a secluded meditation.
If they were fortunate, they might achieve ascension and become
immortals. The disciples were overjoyed and eagerly packed their
belongings to follow their master into the mountains.

The master led them using a teleportation technique to a breathtakingly
beautiful mountain. The mountain was rustling golden leaves, presenting
a scene of crisp, refreshing autumn weather.

At the mountain's peak, there was a hamlet where they set down their
belongings. The master then led them along a path behind the hamlet to
the summit. There, they saw strands of silk hanging in the air, with one
end suspended in the mountain mist and the other reaching high into the
clouds, destination unknown. The master said, "This is the celestial ladder
to the Immortal Kingdom. Hundreds of years ago, your senior brother
ascended to immortality from this very spot."

With that, he handed each of them a peculiar object of a violet color and
said, "This is a pill to aid your ascension. Quickly, my disciples, consume
it."

The disciples, filled with excitement, immediately swallowed the larva-
like objects. A few hesitated, only to see a terrifying and disgusting scene:
the disciples taken the pills had transformed into flat-headed, fleshy
worms. Horrified, they questioned their master, shaking. The master
shook his head and sighed, "when the opportunity arises, your courage
fails, which make you unfit to become immortals."

Before his sigh had ended, the disciples who had transformed into worms
lunged at them...

## Lushleaf

> Amidst the lush leaves' embrace,
> Free from the dust of life's race.
> Branches side by side they stand,
> Their pursuit as firm as land.

Once, a wealthy scion, seeking the path of the immortals, abandoned his
family fortune and retreated to the mountains for solitary practice.
Accustomed to being served, he struggled alone and often faltered in basic
chores. One day, while washing clothes, his basin drifted away. He sat by
the river and wailed aloud. Suddenly, from the rustling trees, a young and
beautiful woman glided down to him.

She landed before him, inquired about his plight, and consoled him,
saying, "Your devotion has moved a spirit of these cypresses such as me.
You have my aid." she would prepare his meals, launder his clothes, and
always leave as silently as she came. Yet, the boy's heart harbored other
thoughts. He said to her, "Since you care for me so, why not join me in
practice as Daoist partners and harmonize yin with yang?"

Enraged by his audacity, the woman sharply rebuked him. "Our practices
take on different paths, and mine has been kept for a millennium. Why
Would I risk this practice because of you?" She left swiftly, but after many
tearful pleas by the river, the boy was forgiven. However, within half a
year, he broached her with the proposal again, persisting in his deluded
fantasy.

The woman, after pondering, said, "How can you speak of the practice of
yin and yang with me before you see my true form? Follow me, and you
shall see."

She led him deep into the woods and revealed a massive, gnarled cypress
tree. She glided onto its canopy and disappeared. The cypress let out a
mighty roar and rose from the ground. With a flick of power, it summoned
the surrounding shrubs. Together, they encircled the boy, intending to
teach him a lesson. Overcome with fear, he fled back to his home and
abandoned his pursuit of Dao.

## Revenant Stalwart

> Endless toil, no rest in view,
> Joy of nature, never ours to pursue.
> Serving others, in vain we strive,
> Lamenting years, centuries alive.

The stalwarts summoned from the underworld by the Keeper were the
lowest-ranking soldiers back there. With their daily duties to maintain the
flow of the underworld, being sent to the mortal realm was akin to the
days of rest-a break from their relentless toil.

One day, as they patrolled Flaming Mountains, four stalwarts shared their
stories. One pointed to Furnace Valley and remarked, "This lava here
makes me think of my task back underground. Those who committed
arson in life are sentenced to embrace searing-hot copper pillars naked in
our Copper Depth. We had to fuel the fire and scrape off burnt flesh once
and again. If we had a Firefall like it here, it would surely make things
easier."

Another added, "True. And those who broke families in life go to our Iron
Depth. We plant an edge of the blade tree into their back and hang them
on the tree. Our endless days are spent sharpening the blades and
trimming the trees. Sometimes, the blade cuts through their flesh and
they fall with wounds wide open. That's when we stitch them up, carry
them from the ground, and hang them on the blade again. A giant iron ball
like the one ahead would make the job much simpler."

The third one chimed in, "You have it easy. Those who torture animals go
to our Bull Depth. There, they are trampled and gored by lavabulls. We
must tend the bulls, fit them with iron hooves, and sharpen their horns.
The crushed corpses must be dug out occasionally, lest they clog the path
of the bulls. A flaming cart would be a much better solution."

The last stalwart, gazing at the landscape of Flaming Mountains,
exclaimed, "This place is better than any of our Depths. Don't you see?
This is the best Depth with state-of-the-art torturing tools. I am now living
in my dream!" Hearing this, all his companions spat in disdain and left.

## Revenant Archer

> He who brings tales of fault and blame,
> Is often caught in the very same game.
> Trust not the one who seems most fair,
> And in their 'goodness', be aware.

In the southern camp of the Kingdom of Yuetuo, near the western side of
the Flaming Mountains, a cook in the army was tasked with delivering
food to the soldiers each and every day. During his routine, he often
noticed a shadowy figure trailing him. When his courage led him to
confront it, he discovered it was a pottery figurine, armed with an
arrowless bow-a truly peculiar sight.

It is known that only the guilty are haunted. The cook, assured of his clear
conscience, demanded, "Why do you always follow me?" The figurine,
faceless yet speaking from within, replied, "In a past life, we were from the
same town and served together in the army. I was wounded by an enemy
arrow and you abandoned me. I was left to succumb to infection and die.
My resentment prevented me from reincarnation, and Yama, the King of
the Underworld, made me a revenant. I have come now for your life."

Puzzled, the cook asked, "Then why not kill me?" The figurine raised its
bow, replying, "This bow shoots only arrows of punishment. You've been
reasonably upright in this life, so I find no arrow to strike you. My only
choice now is to linger aimlessly." The cook asked if there was anything he
could do to stop its wandering, but the figurine spat back, "It was your
fault. You should atone, not 'help' me. Your debt will clear once you've
recited Buddha's name for me ten thousand times and kneeled to each.
Then, I may find peace."

Enraged by such entitlement, the cook argued, "Your fall in enemy hands
wasn't my arrow; your failure to evade wasn't my push. Leaving you was a
choice, not a crime. Why blame me?" With that, he smashed the pottery
figurine with his meal lid. The figurine shattered and turned to dust in the
wind.
Alas, even ghosts dread violence. Reflecting on one's actions is essential,
and kindness is a virtue. But beware of being exploited for your good
heart, lest the accused becomes the accuser.

## Lavabull Revenant

> High and mighty, in the finest attire,
> Yet a twist of fate, from life to mire.
> The underworld trials are no mere lore,
> They know it all when they see your core.

In the Kingdom of Pure Joy, there dwelled a high official from a lineage of
glory. His father, a beacon of honor and privilege, has passed recently. Not
long after, the official himself met a sudden death.

His soul, bewildered, found itself in the depths of the underworld,
surrounded by terrifying sights. He came to a halt before a colossal stone
gate, and peered inside. There, he saw charred corpses on their knees,
twisted and shrunken from the relentless flames, their faces erased under
chains and shackles. Among them, one scorched figure struggled to rise,
shouting, "Zirong, my son, it's me, your father!"

Better, the official's childhood name, resonated with truth. He hastily
asked, "Father, why are you here? I held so many rituals made for your
passage." The charred spirit replied, "They're futile. Virtues in life bring
fortune in the next, but wrongdoings must be paid now. My misdeeds
caused many deaths, and Yama condemned me to the ceaseless depths, to
burn eternally. My son, do not follow my path."

Then, five more charred spirits emerged, his ancestors going back to his
great-great-grandfather, all echoing the same warning. Suddenly, a
chilling wind blew, and the stone gate slammed shut. The official awoke
back among the living. For a time, he lived modestly, yet the hardships of
simplicity soon wore him down. Convincing himself that it was nothing
more than a dream, he slipped back into his lavish ways.

## Revenant Charface

> Time gallops like a horse so fair,
> Here and there, seeming without care.
> Past flows like water in its course,
> Dreams buried deep, without remorse.

The gates of the City of Injustice are guarded by the charfaces. Unlike soul
reapers, they wield blades of karmic flames, burning lost souls to ash-
hence their perpetually smoked visages.

One day, two charfaces at the gate caught a soul trying to sneak out. As
one raised his flaming blade to strike, the desperate soul pleaded, "Spare
me, kind sirs. Should I revive, I'll burn ten houses of paper ingots in your
honor." The other charface restrained his companion and proposed, "Let's
have a wager then. If you win, you go free. But if you lose, blame your own
luck." The soul asked, "What would be the wager?" And he answered: "If
half the souls entering the city today wish to return to life like you, you
win." With that, he handed over paper and ink and tasked the soul with
recording the names and earthly obsessions of those newly deceased.

As the gate closed for the day, the soul hurried to the charfaces and
declared, "I've won! I've won indeed!" The charfaces presented the list to
the Gatemaster, who found that it matched perfectly in both numbers and
names and even included details the deceased themselves hadn't
revealed. Satisfied, the Gatemaster held the soul in high regard,
generously rewarded him, and said, "1 know you seek to leave the city, but
the gates are shut for today. Perhaps you should come again tomorrow."

Months passed with the soul returning daily, and each day a similar bet
was made. Over time, the soul ceased longing for a return to life and took
up a role as a scribe under the Gatemaster.

Alas, it makes one wonder: should we look ahead and accept whatever
future awaits us, or stay committed to steadfast goals? Perhaps there's no
right answer. What matters is the willingness to make your choice.

## Lavabat

> In flames that leap and kiss the sky,
> Down to the earth, their fiery flight.
> Forged in flames, they rise once more,
> Braving trials for powers pure.

Flaming Mountains harbored numerous caves, yet most were filled with
flowing lava, unfit for dwelling or practice. Finding a cool cavern was a
prized rarity. However, as adept flyers in the mountains, the lesser bat
guais often discovered comfortable caves on sheer cliffs. Unfortunately,
the larger guais followed suit and claimed these caves for themselves.
Angered by constant displacements, the bats were resolute in moving to
Furnace Valley, a place of towering firefalls and rivers of molten rock. No
other guais would dare to venture there, and all advised them to leave.
The bats, undeterred, dismissed the warnings and retorted, "We can
never secure a comfortable hideout when you are around. That's why
we've chosen the most dangerous and treacherous place. In our spiritual
practice here, it's a matter of life or death; we're done being victims and
pushed around!"

Fortune favored their resolve and rewarded their practice. Though the
scorching lava burnt them time and again, it forged their fiery skins, and
dodging the spewing magma honed their agility.

Alas, no path is set in life. While well-trodden roads may offer smoother
travel, striking out anew invites trials and derision. Yet, the fruits of such a
journey are uniquely gratifying.

## Bull Sergeant

> 'Neath fiery peaks in robes so fine,
> Guarding jade doors with gold's radiant shine.
> Tangled in those worldly gains,
> All splendor fades, like dust, it wanes.

Through the ages, those seeking rain from the Plantain Fan often
presented gifts and tributes. As the chief guard in Rakshasi's court, the Bull
Sergeant was in charge of collecting these offerings.

The quality of the tributes greatly affected the well-being of the
mountains' yaoguais throughout the year. Thus, the Bull Sergeant always
schemed to influence the tributes towards his own preferences. One day,
leaning on the doorframe and sighing deeply, he noticed the smoke from
his nose resembled his beloved chicken and devised a plan.

He told all the tribute bearers that the shape of the smoke rising from
Flaming Mountains at dusk indicated what the Plantain Fan desired as
offerings. Believing this to be a divine sign, the people, despite their
hardships, started contributing exactly as the smoke suggested. The Bull
Sergeant received many of his desired items and reveled in a contented
life. However, over time, this led to growing discontent among the
villagers toward Rakshasi and her rains.

One day, Lady Rakshasi had to leave for a lecture by Lord Lao in the
Celestial Court and was unable to bring rain for the people. In panic, the
Bull Sergeant confessed his wrongdoings and begged for her forgiveness.
It turned out she never required any tributes; she naturally provided rain
for the villagers through the seasons for planting and growing. The whole
tribute scheme was a fabrication.

Lady Rakshasi didn't punish the Bull Sergeant but ordered him to return
the goods and tell the truth to the villagers. But they refused to take back
their offerings; instead, they urged the Sergeant to convince the Plantain
Fan for more rain. Caught between the villagers and the Lady, the
Sergeant ended up berated by both sides: the bull scorned by all.

![Bull Sergeant](/image-20240827220704073.png)

## Bull Soldier

> Strong of body, skilled in fight,
> Shield and spear, a valorous sight.
> Heart ablaze with fervent zeal,
> Love's disdain, the pain he feels.

Three centuries ago, when the Bull King still graced the Celestial Court
and the Red Boy practiced under Guanyin, peace reigned over Flaming
Mountains.

One day, Bishui Beast promoted a captain among the bull soldiers, and the
captain moved into the night-duty chamber of the Rakshasa Palace to
accommodate his increased responsibilities.

He occupied the adjoining room for rest and the main west chamber for
hosting guests. One morning, he found the guest room had been tidily
arranged overnight: dustless furniture, washed fruits on plates, and
freshly brewed tea. Perplexed, he thought of the furry celestial maidens
serving the Lady and the fox maidens attending the King's daughter.
Recalling how the other guards often teased him for being more
handsome than the rest, now, as a new captain, he couldn't help but feel
elated-surely, there must be a secret admirer.

For over a month, this mysterious "kind-hearted maiden" visited nightly
yet never revealed herself. Growing impatient, the captain resolved to
wait outside the chamber one night. Around the fourth watch, he heard
heavy steps, quite unlike the gentle maidens, furred or fox. Regardless, he
lunged at the figure as soon as the door opened and secured a tight hold

on it. The figure was muscular and sturdy, too large for his arms. Muffled
grunts followed, and the voice of the Bull Sergeant emerged,"I like things
tidy, and your room is always messy. That's why I'd clean it up after my
night duty. You don't have to act so... grateful..."

## Bull Stalwart

> In remote corners, evil shows its face,
> Yet the good seeks the divine's embrace.
> Evil's end is found in fire's relentless glow,
> While the good is shielded, be it high or low.

In a village beneath Flaming Mountains, the impoverished residents
subsisted solely on rice cakes and wore nothing but coarse linen clothes.
To appease the yaoguais in the mountains for rain, they had a grim custom:
sending elders over sixty as offerings.

Old Xu, a Dao aspirant in his youth, only grew stronger with age, and his
vitality hinted at a long life. Yet, on his sixtieth birthday, in the midst of a
lavish celebration, the villagers placed him on a ceremonial altar and
carried him to a stone temple in the mountains to be sacrificed.
Confined in the temple, Old Xu grew weak from hunger and thirst. At the
brink of death, the temple doors swung open, and two enormous figures
"He's still breathing. Go, let's check on him." He was then approached by
two bull guais clad in armor, each wielding a pair of hammers. Frozen in
fear, he remained voiceless.

However, the guais, instead of harming him, handed him a sack of water
and shared their dried food. They then instructed him: "Leave the temple
and follow the path marked by bamboo stakes to find the main road. From
there, the west leads to the Kingdom of Sacrifice, and the east to the
Kingdom of Women. Choose your way.""

Recovering his senses, Old Xu asked why they spared him. One of the guais
replied, "You mortals underestimate us. If we were to feast on humans, we
wouldn't choose the elderly! Our Lady has often sent the old back, but
everyone she sent back ended up murdered. Now we guide you old ones
to seek life elsewhere. Eat quickly and be on your way."
With that, the bull guais left Old Xu alone and resumed their patrol with
their hammers swinging.

## Searing-Fire

> Eternal life, a simple dream,
> True ascent, a distant gleam.
> The world seeks shortcuts, lost in their quest,
> With countless sacrifices, they never rest.

Outside the walls of the Kingdom of Sacrifice, atop the mountains, stood
the Fumefire Temple. Renowned for its ability to reform wayward youths
from fallen households, the temple was spoken highly of for guiding lost
souls toward righteous paths. This tale, as told by a landowner, is about
one such disciple, Zhao San.

Zhao San was a vagabond. He beguiled guests of brothels into lavish
spending, and one of his patrons turned out to be Landowner Wang's son.
He soon found himself pursued by the authorities and facing a trial against
Wang. A Daoist from the Fumefire Temple happened upon him and
offered sanctuary.

From that point forward, Zhao San immersed himself in the pursuit of
wisdom, practiced diligently, and dutifully undertook tasks assigned by
his master. One day, when he descended the mountain on an errand, he
came across Meiniang, a concubine being mistreated by the wife of a
household during their journey to the temple. Without hesitation, Zhao
San intervened, rescued Meiniang, and brought her to the temple to
shield her from the cruelty of that family.
With nowhere else to turn, Meiniang was welcomed into the temple by
the master and became a disciple. Filled with gratitude for Zhao San saving
her life, she tended to the temple's chores. Over time, she repeatedly
sought to become Zhao San's spiritual partner, yet her advances were
always rebuffed.

Years later, having made significant spiritual progress, Zhao San
underwent an ascension ceremony organized by his master, with
Meiniang invited as a witness. They were taken to a mountain peak with a
river of fire flowing down. Zhao San received a talisman from his master
and courageously leaped into the fire. Filled with a longing to practice
alongside him, Meiniang followed suit amidst cheers and blessings.

As the smoke rose, they were reborn from the blazing flames as the eternal
guardians of the river of lava. Thus, in the fiery embrace, they found
immortality and everlasting life, forever part of the river's endless flow.

## Scorching-Fire

> Ignorance ignites a fool's fire,
> Daily anguish in a somber mire.
> Enduring a life of ceaseless pain,
> They yearn for death, not celestial gain.

Legend has it that during the reign of the Yellow Emperor, an official of
pottery named Ningfengzi learned the art of fire with five-colored fumes
from immortals, and tried to ascend by roasting himself over the flames.
Some say he achieved ascension; others claim he burned himself to death;
no one knows the truth. The tale we have here is recounted by a runaway
disciple from the Fumefire Temple in the Kingdom of Sacrifice, a place
rooted in the art of the five-colored fumefire.

The master of the disciple served as the abbot of the temple. One day, the
disciple accompanied his master for some liquor in town, and they came
across a fugitive being pursued by officers. As the temple was short on
help, and the fugitive was a wealthy one, they offered him shelter. This
man, Zhao San, was a mere wastrel who lured patrons of brothels into
extravagant spending. The temple was already home to various robbers
and bandits, and it proved to be a corrupting influence on Zhao San. In the
company of fellow criminals every day, he soon became ten times more
villainous than before.

One day, Zhao San set off to rob travelers to fund his own lavish lifestyle.
He targeted a wealthy family returning from their monthly worship, and
in an act driven by greed and lust, he abducted the family's concubine,
Meiniang.

Imprisoned within the temple walls, Meiniang endured daily chores and
beatings. Despite her deep resentment towards Zhao San, she was
powerless against his violence. She could only grit her teeth and bide her
time, hoping for an escape.

Years later, a ceremony for ascension was announced in the temple. The
disciple who tells this story was tasked with escorting Meiniang to the
event, held atop a high cliff overlooking a river of lava. Zhao San had
already prepared to leap into the fire for ascension with a talisman from
his master. He insisted Meiniang accompany him. Amidst the frenzied
cheers of the followers and the terrified cries of Meiniang, the disciple
pushed the girl off the cliff as ordered.

Charred in the river of lava, their bodies swelled grotesquely as the lava,
guided by the talisman, seeped into their skulls. Their distorted new forms
staggered up, writhing in agony, and ran towards the depths of the black
mountains. Witnessing this horrifying transformation, the disciple
renounced his belief in the temple's teachings, no matter how vehemently
the master rationalized it as a transcendent metamorphosis.

## Flamling

> Amidst joy, a gentle spirit gleams,
> In anger, darkness sows its schemes.
> Beneath the earth, a silent foe,
> Flames within, slyly aglow.

Ancient texts speak of Flame Ore, bearing a resemblance to cinnabar ore
but being non-toxic and more potent for pill refinement. Its sought-after
properties for enhancing both yin and yang energies attracted many pill
crafters. Yet, this rare substance of the mountain spirits remains elusive
and priceless.

Then there was Cheng Ming, a man obsessed with oddities, scorned by his
family for his poverty. Learning that Flame Ores were formed within
Flamlings, he set out to profit from it. Selling all he had, he plunged into
the mountains, fixated on capturing a Flamling.

Days turned to weeks with no news, save that his makeshift shelter
mysteriously burned down. Raging at his misfortune, he saw a large red
worm emerge from the ground before him-half-buried, half-exposed,
with the innocent face of a child, much like a disciple of Guanyin's.
Startled by Cheng Ming's fury, it wept. Cheng Ming shouted to scare and
silence it, but it only angered the Flamling, who swiftly burrowed away.

It was only then that Cheng Ming realized it was a Flamling. He leaped
about, hoping to lure it out again. Finally, the guai, annoyed perhaps,
burrowed out and struck him with a fireball. The clothes and skin of
Cheng Ming caught on fire, and he rolled on the ground in pain and
despair.

He broke down in tears, realizing that he couldn't seize the Flame Ore by
himself. Then, amused and curious, the Flamling drew near him. For this
one time, Cheng Ming chose to be brutal and resolute; he smashed its
head with a rock until it was completely shattered.

Cheng Ming continued this merciless act and harvested plenty of Flame
Ores, but he kept his methods a secret. His growing sales of the ores
eventually earned him fame as a renowned medicine gatherer far and
wide.

## Tenner

> Within the gloom, the monkeys roam,
> Far away from their lauded home.
> Ensnared in traps, as troubles brew,
> In revenge's journey, what's cause, what's due?

Centuries ago, the troops of the Court razed Mount Huaguo once more.
Upon hearing of the Great Sage's death, many monkeys left their home in
sorrow and began searching for new sanctuaries for their practice. Given
the Great Sage's past association with the Bull King, many sought his
protection at Flaming Mountains.

The Bull King hated monkeys as the Great Sage had betrayed him, yet he
offered shelter to these distressed refugees. But life in Flaming Mountains
was harsh, afflicted with scorching heat and frequent harassment from
outer yaoguais. Fortunately, the Keeper of the land treated them kindly,
providing food and support, and earned the trust of the monkeys.

Soon, however, a plague struck. The monkeys' fur began to fall out, their
skin festered with sores, and large black boils, horrifying and infectious,
sprouted on their backs. The plague spread rapidly, leaving many in such
agony that death seemed a preferable fate. The Macaque Chief, their
leader, ordered the infected to be cast into the scorching Furnace Valley
to fend for themselves there.

Abandoned and dying, these monkeys cursed their former kin. As death
neared, the Keeper came and saved them with astounding cures. In weeks,
their skin healed; in months, their boils burst, and revealed dark wings.
The Keeper taught them to fly, accepted their loyalty, and enlisted them
as his tenth-ranked minions, named the Tenners.

Their first task was to purge the camp of the Macaque Chief. Ruthlessly,
they slaughtered their kin, sparing only the cunning Macaque Chief, who
managed to escape to an unknown fate.

## Earth Rakshasa

> Round eyes that gleam so bright,
> A body drenched in blood's light.
> With a seven-treasure hat adorned,
> A sincere heart, though face is scorned.

The Land Rakshasas are descendants of the Sea Rakshasas, born during
their exile. Due to the different Will of their new home, they did not grow
to the enormous size of their ancestors. Despite this, their loyalty to the
Rakshasa Lady remains as steadfast as that of their forebears. They strictly
adhere to the precepts set by the Rakshasi, diligently practicing their arts
and shedding many of their old vices.

There are many folk tales about Rakshasas being fond of eating human
flesh, which is why villages near Flaming Mountains often send their
elderly to the stone temple as offerings. In truth, the Rakshasas of Flaming
Mountains do not eat humans. On the contrary, because their immense
strength can easily harm mortals, the Rakshasi gives them specially crafted
heavy shields and instructs them to focus more on defend than attack.
However, if pushed to their limits, they will still unleash their fire-
breathing abilities.

Even though the Land Rakshasas have made many changes, people still
scream and flee in terror at the sight of their fearsome appearance. But
from the perspective of the Land Rakshasas, aren't those screaming
mortals just as terrifying?

![Earth Rakshasa](/image-20240827220930602.png)

## Sea Rakshasa

> My land is harsh and my look stern,
> Yet at their scorn, I never turn.
> True valor looks not on the skin,
> I should have known who is my kin.

Lore tells of the Great Kingdom of Rakshasa beyond the Western Seas,
where the Sea Rakshasas call home. Renowned for their peculiar features,
they differ starkly from those on land.

One year, sea yaoguais were reported troubling a temple by the sea. The
princess of the Kingdom was tasked with the expulsion of yaoguais. A
devout practitioner of Buddhism with formidable powers, she dismissed
her entourage and resolved to confront the yaoguais alone.

As she recited scriptures loudly in the temple that night, she saw several
towering figures kneel at the door, grotesque in form: lumpy heads,
twisted mouths, three-holed noses, and eyes upon their foreheads.

Startled by their hideousness, the princess fell to the ground in fright. The
figures, too, pointed at her face, screaming in terror, and hastily fled.
Intrigued by their unexpected reaction, she called out to them.
The fear that drove them to run was quenched only after the princess
resumed her chanting. They cautiously returned and conversed with her,
after which she learned that they were Sea Rakshasas seeking spiritual
practice.

The princess welcomed them in. To avoid alarming the people, she
fashioned golden, gem-studded masks for them. Soon, the Rakshasa King
granted them massive shields and appointed them as the royal guards of
the princess.

Hundreds of years later, after the Kingdom of Rakshasa fell, the Sea
Rakshasas escorted the princess eastward to Flaming Mountains. Faced
with hardships, they learned to consume fire to better protect their
princess, which turned their blue skin crimson. Now, they reside in the
river of lava, mastering the tides of flame in the mountains. The princess,
long past her prime, finds solace in the unwavering loyalty of her guards,
who value her heart over her faded beauty.

## Flame Rhino Master

> Towering horn, a crown so rare,
> In simple garb, a presence fair.
> To the kind man, it shows its thanks,
> Wishing him joy in life's ranks.

In the ancient Kingdom of Dvaravati, rhinoceroses were widely raised and
adored. Once, during a rhino hunt, the king shot a pregnant female. As she
lay dying, she birthed a calf. Amused, the king took the young rhino back
to the royal gardens.

Haunted by its mother's death, the rhino feared the palace folk. At the
mere sight of them, it would flee in terror, prompting the courtiers to
chase it for sport, whip in hand.

It wasn't until its horn grew sharp enough that the rhino found its chance
to avenge its mother: it gored a courtier during his chase. The king,
enraged, called for a butcher to slay the beast. But the butcher, moved by
pity, smeared dog blood on the rhino to feign its death and smuggled it
out of the palace. Kept it hidden amongst his own rhinos, he nurtured it
with prized wheat and lived with it for years.

One night, the butcher dreamt of the rhino speaking, "I was destined to
transcend my form and become a yaoguai in this life. But your kindness
calls for a reward, and I am willing to sacrifice this future to repay you.
Tomorrow is when your life will end, and all my years left, I will give you.
My horn will be left on your table. When you pass, have your wife burn it.
If it burns completely, you shall live again."

The next day, the butcher found the horn but no sign of the rhino. He told
his wife what to do and soon breathed his last. Following his instructions,
his wife burned the horn for forty-nine days and nights. Astonishingly, the
butcher was resurrected, yet he was different: he had grown a long rhino
horn, and his skin had turned blue. Years later, still youthful after his wife
passed, he became a disciple of Princess Rakshasi and was revered as the
Rhino Master.

## Bull Governor

> The old bull's halberd-tip gleams,
> Karmic flames scorch his shoulders' seams.
> Guiding souls through life's end,
> Toils endlessly in the mortal land.

In bygone days, a young boy hid in a neighbor's storeroom to play with
fire. Accidentally, he ignited the items inside. Fearing punishment, he
attempted to extinguish the flames himself, but they quickly grew out of
control. The entire storeroom was consumed, and tragically, the boy
perished in the blaze.

His death left behind a great calamity. The neighbors demanded
compensation for the lost items from his parents, while his parents
demanded compensation for their son's life. The arguments raged on, and
even on the seventh day after the boy's death, the day that his soul should
be fetched, no resolution was reached. With the ritual at the funeral
disrupted, and the Bull- Head and Horse-Face, the soul fetchers, refused
to escort his soul. Seeing his subordinates' reluctance, the Bull Governor
decided to escort the boy himself.

As they approached the boy's home, they heard the sounds of his parents
quarreling with the neighbors. Entering the courtyard, they saw the boy's
parents accusing, "Our son died in your storeroom. Who knows if he
stumbled upon some illicit activity and was silenced?" The neighbors
retorted, "Our storeroom held valuable items. Your son must have had
thieving intentions, causing the fire. You must compensate us."

Their heated dispute eventually became ended up violence. The Bull
Governor asked the boy, "Did you ever foresee this outcome?" The boy,
filled with regret, wept bitterly. The Bull Governor, in his compassion,
said, "Enough. Such chaos on a soul-fetching day is disrespectful." With
that, flames erupted from his shoulder, and he struck an old tree in the
courtyard with his halberd, setting it ablaze. The tree was charred black,
and only then did the quarreling crowd remember it was the soul-
fetching day. In a panic, they all fled the courtyard..

## Eagle Soldier

> Immortals and mortals, all shrouded in haze,
> Trials they must pass through life's winding maze.
> How many find wisdom, break free from the chain,
> Escaping the cycles of suffering and pain?

Three men died on the same day, and their souls met in the underworld.
Kneeling before the judge, the judge pointed to one soul and said, "In life,
you were a thief, robbing and injuring others, bullying the innocent. Now,
I sentence you to the Mountain of Knives to atone for your sins." The man
wailed, "My kins burnt gold and silver paper ingots for me, and they could
fill ten storerooms. If you show mercy, all that wealth is yours." The judge
remained unmoved, flicked his sleeve, and had the underworld soldiers
take him away.

The judge then pointed to the second soul and said, "You shall be reborn
as a human." The soul protested,"1 diligently practiced Buddhism, did
many good deeds, and never harmed any living being. Why must I endure
the suffering of reincarnation?" The judge replied, "A human may see a
hundred springs, but the grass knows only one. Being reborn as a human is
already a privilege. Do you wish to be reborn as a beast?" The soul was
displeased and said, "Life as a human is arduous. I practiced Buddhism,
and it should grant me escape." The judge snorted coldly,"Today,
Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha is not here. Whether you escape or not is not up
to you." He flicked his sleeve, and the underworld soldiers took him away.

Finally, the judge pointed to the last soul and said, "In life, you stole mind
cores, and made pills which harmed lives. Now, I sentence you to the Pool
of Blood to cleanse your sins before you can reincarnate." Just as he was
about to have the underworld soldiers take him away, a celestial captain in
golden armor flashed into the hall, threw a military order on the table, and
said, "He has attained profound enlightenment. This is a summons from
the Celestial Court. The Admiral has sent me to escort him to become a
celestial soldier." Hearing this, the soul was overjoyed and quickly
followed the celestial general out.

![Eagle Soldier](/image-20240827221042505.png)

## Hound Soldier

> Bright helm with shining armor paired,
> Golden spear with carvings flared.
> With the universe's mystic power grand,
> All is cleansed in the sacred land.

The story continues with the soul that escaped the underworld, now
ascending to the upper realm, filled with excitement. He followed the
celestial captain through alleys and corridors, eventually arriving at the
armory. The captain said, "These are the Chu-Bai armors, unmatched in
the mortal world." He then selected a set and handed it to the soul. They
proceeded to the side hall, but instead of entering the main hall, they
went to a side chamber where a minor official handed them a contract,
instructing the soul to sign and seal it.

The minor official indifferently warned, "By signing this contract, you
agree to serve in the Celestial Court forever, with no chance of
reincarnation." The soul, glancing around at the grandeur of the palace
and the elegance of the celestial beings, signed and sealed the contract
immediately.

The celestial captain then led the soul to the Tushita Palace. Again, they
did not enter the main hall but turned through a corridor to a massive
tower at the back. Thick black smoke billowed from the top, and many
soldiers were waiting outside, holding armor, ready to enter.

As the soul stepped inside, he felt the scorching heat. Numerous furnaces
blazed with fierce flames, and a giant cauldron hung above, melting
copper and iron. A Daoist boy with a fan approached, smiling,,"Celestia
soldier, heed my plea. Your flesh is gone, your soul must be. Bound to
armor, fierce and bold. In battles fought, be brave, yet hold. For if you
falter, heed this call, your very soul shall perish, fall."

With that, the boy pushed the soul into a mold, arranging the armor
pieces. Still bewildered, the soul saw the giant cauldron tilt above him,
pouring boiling molten metal. His piercing screams echoed through the
tower.

![Hound Soldier](/image-20240827221100645.png)

## Jackal Soldier

> The mighty general, like thunderclouds,
> Descends with lightning to the mortal crowds.
> In battles fierce, both sides contend,
> Life was hard, and hardships transcend.

The newly forged soul, having barely accustomed to his armors yet, heard
that the Jade Emperor, in his fury, had dispatched a hundred thousand
celestial soldiers to descend and subdue yaoguais. Fearing that he was not
yet skilled with his weapon, the celestial captain gave him an iron bow and
instructed him to stay at the rear and shoot arrows.

Descending to the mortal realm with the others, he saw banners flying and
weapons gleaming. Eighteen celestial nets covered the mountains, and it
seemed all celestial beings, be their constellation officers or admiral had
come to surround the area tight. The battle raged with relentless fury,
sand and stones whirling through the air. The sky and earth darkened as
dust and debris filled the universe.

The newly recruited celestial soldier had barely fought when a powerful
force stunned him. When he awoke, he found himself in front of a tower
behind the Tushita Palace corridor. Two Daoist boys were carrying him
inside. A Daoist boy greeted him with a smile, "Luckily, your armor isn't
ruined, or you couldn't be healed." As he spoke, the boy pushed him into a
mold, arranged the armor pieces, and poured boiling metal over him
again.

Emerging from the quenching pool, a lightning flash sent him back to the
battlefield.

Dazed and still in pain, the new soldier stood on the battlefield, unsure of
which celestial deity had struck him again with a golden wave, and he
found himself once more in front of the Tushita Palace tower.
After that, he was burned, drowned, and shocked, but each time his armor
remained whole. Hence, he was reforged and sent back to the battlefield
again.

Unbearable! He grabbed a weapon from the ground, finally resolving that
he could not suffer alone. Rebelling against the Celestial Court seemed the
only way out.

![Jackal Soldier](/image-20240827221118352.png)

## Captain of the Court

> Immortal rites bestow eternal life,
> A body forged in steel, free from strife.
> Though sorrow lingers, pain remains,
> In cycles of rebirth, truth regains.

Continuing from the previous story, the soul had been a celestial soldier
for a thousand years and had risen through the ranks to become a captain
of the court. Despite his promotion, he felt lost and uncertain. In life, he
had not attained enlightenment, and as a celestial soldier, the highest rank
he could achieve was that of a captain. Many former celestial captains, in
an attempt to change their fate, had fled to the mortal realm, only to be
hunted down and killed, their souls dissipating with no chance of
reincarnation.

This time, upon hearing of upheaval at Mount Huaguo, the Celestial Court
dispatched celestial soldiers to the mortal realm. Missing one headcount,
the celestial captain received orders to select a soul from the underworld.
He approached the judge and saw three kneeling souls. He chose the one
who had practiced Daoism and brought him out of the underworld. The
soul, seeing the celestial captain's gleaming armor, the cold edge of his
blade, and the intricately carved shield of solid iron, was excited. The
celestial captain paused and asked something he wasn't supposed to: "If
you come with me today, you will have no chance of reincarnation. As a
deity, the highest rank you can achieve is my position. Are you still willing
to go?"

The soul replied, "Yes, yes, I am willing. I don't know if there will be any
other opportunities in reincarnation. I might go through countless cycles
of rebirth only to suffer even more." Knowing that the soul would not
change his mind, the celestial captain had to take him to the upper realm.

![Captain of the Court](/image-20240827221139002.png)

## Bullguard

> Majestic of height, he looms with might,
> In heavy armor, ready to fight.
> His eyes-a fearsome, vacant lot,
> A sage or fool, we know not.

Being the gatekeeper of the mountain was a thankless task indeed. For
more than a century, Bullguard stood watch, never once climbing the
ranks. Yet he voiced no grievances, for his devotion to the king was his sole
concern, and the king's pills, his only desire. He treasured those pills
within a lacquered box of pear wood, lined with silk. Each time he partook
of them, he performed a ritual: a process of cleansing, rinsing, and offering
incense to the universe, thanking it for its gifts. Many a lesser guai had
tasted the king's rewards, but none with such reverence as Bullguard.

One day, a curious guai inquired,"How do you maintain such vigor
despite the toils of this job?" With earnest simplicity, Bullguard replied,
"It is the king's pill that fuels me. Take more, and you shall be as I am." The
guai confessed, "We've partaken in our share, yet felt nothing. Mayhaps
the king's gifts to you are finer?" Bullguard was aghast, "From the same
hand we are served, how could there be a 'mine' and 'yours'?" The guai
still skeptical, insisted on an exchange of pills. Soon after, the guai felt no
change, while Bullguard remained as robust as ever.

Some say, "A fool's luck", but perhaps it isn't a lack of wit that's
compensated, but the power drawn from blind devotion.

![Bullguard](/image-20240827232042074.png)

## Guangzhi

> To prove his worth, he gave sinister advice,
> Yet reaped the bitter fruits of his own vice.
> Though justice remains silent, it never sleeps,
> And when it strikes, no one escapes its reach.

In his youth, Guangzhi was not a monk but a little wolf guai who yearned
to be human.

He often took human shape to play in town, but the people always saw
through him and chased him away. When he asked the other yaoguais
why, they explained, "You may look like them, but you don't act like them.
That's why they know. If you want to learn to be human, go live among
them. Spend time with them to learn their ways and manners." He took
this advice to heart and begged his master to grant this wish. His master,
old Lingxuzi, who was close to the Black Bear Guai in the mountain,
agreed. The Black Bear Guai transformed the pup into a little monk and
sent him to study under Elder Jinchi, an old friend.

At first, the fellow monks disliked him. They played tricks on him, and he
always fell for it, slow and gullible as he was. Jinchi named him Guangzhi,
"the Great Wisdom", hoping he would grow clever and sharp, so his
fellow monks couldn't bully him. With Jinchi's care and teaching,
Guangzhi learned to read, write, and abide by the monastic rules.
Gradually, he assimilated into their ranks.

One day, two monks arrived at the temple. One had a fair, devout
countenance, while the other had a face covered in fur. They possessed a
wondrous treasure: the Kasaya of Eversparks. Jinchi had never seen
anything like it before and longed for it desperately. Hoping to repay
Jinchi's teachings and nurturing, Guangzhi devised a plan to acquire it for
him.

Guangzhi never imagined his mistake would ignite red tides of flames that
engulfed the temple he called home. Afterward, Jinchi took his own life,
and Lingxuzi fell to the Jingubang. Even the Black Bear Guai surrendered
and was taken by Guanyin. Guangzhi saw how many had suffered for his
sake, and knew he had failed utterly at being human. He shed his monk
robes and retreated to the mountains, repenting with Jinchi's teachings.

In his years of practice in the mountains, he forged a new weapon inspired
by the raging flames he saw that night. He named it "the Red Tides". Even
to this day, after numerous years, he continues to hear a persistent call
echoing through the mountains: "Guangzhi, Guangzhi!" Who could it be
that keeps calling him?

![Guangzhi](/image-20240827232059524.png)

## Guangmou

> With a monk's facade but a serpent's heart,
> He wields deceit, playing many parts.
> His desires shift, insatiably pursued,
> Faithless to his master, all teachings he eschewed.

Guangmou, "the Great Tactician", was not like his senior fellow pupil
Guangzhi. From a young age, His heart yearned to be a legendary yaoguai
master, remembered for ages.

But fate had other plans. When old Lingxuzi sent his beloved disciple to
Guanyin Temple to be a monk, old White Snake Guai grew worried. The
snake feared it was old Lingxuzi's ploy to win favor with the Black Bear
Guai, and commanded Guangmou to join the monkhood as well.

Before he left, the snake warned him: never fall behind, least of all behind
Guangzhi. But no matter how hard Guangmou tried, Elder Jinchi never
seemed to favor him as much as Guangzhi, even when he learned faster
and trained harder. Guangmou consoled himself, believing this stemmed
not from his own failings, but from the snake's ham-fisted meddling,
which had turned the Elder against him. He found solace in the notion of
returning to the mountains one day, when he could embrace his yaoguai
nature, unshackled by such trivial concerns.

Guangmou can still recall Jinchi's teachings: "You can be too extreme, too
uncompromising. Always leave some room and some things unfinished."
But the day Jinchi saw the Kasaya of Eversparks, he desired it so intensely
that he forgot his own words and wept long into the night. Guangmou
saw the thought taking root in the old monk's heart: to kill for this prize.
Everyone shied away from the idea, but Guangzhi boldly spoke the truth.

Guangmou seethed with inexplicable rage. In his mind, a scheme within a
scheme began to take shape. As Elder Jinchi drank tea with the two monks,
Guangmou glimpsed an untamed malice in the monkey's eyes—a hunger
for vengeance. Building on Guangzhi's gambit, Guangmou goaded and
prodded, weaving a merciless plot that left no room for escape. The old
monk was delighted, and for the first time, he acknowledged Guangmou's
wit.

With his plan set, Guangmou knew that doom would strike that night.
Summoning a gust of wind, he hid in the bamboo grove behind the
mountain. As anticipated, a great fire broke out that night. But it failed to
kill the two journeying monks as intended. Instead, it burned the entire
temple to the ground.

Alas, the world harbors such petty souls, capable of ensnaring the lofty
and vanquishing them with cunning plots. Perhaps this is what is meant by
"slaying with a borrowed blade."

## Baw-Li-Guhh-Lang

> Wrinkles on his skin so snug,
> A whiff of air, a fishy hug.
> Legs that spring to heights above,
> From the dirt and muck they love.

In the lands west of Black Wind Mountain, within a kingdom named
Hhami, stood a small town. Every day before dawn, a humble market
would gather just outside the town gate. It was a place where peddlers
exchanged goods while waiting for the gate to open, but due to the prices,
even the townsfolk began to participate. Thus, this market gradually
gained its reputation.

A few months ago, an odd oil peddler arrived at the market. Garbed in
robes of a pearly turquoise color and with eyes that gleamed like copper
bells. He had a voice that rang out with a boom, and his breath was foul
and pungent. Yet, he happened to be a keen talker and naturally was
disliked by everyone. The oil he produces, on the other hand, was sought
after by everyone. Who would not prefer the oil clear and smooth, and
not to mention its price: one could exchange but a pinch of fragrant
powder for a large gourd of such oil.

One day, a wandering Daoist passed through the town and decided to visit
the market. He enjoyed his experience until he sensed an eerie green mist
emanating from that old peddler-a guai, no doubt. The monk chanted,
and before the peddler could manage a decent struggle, it revealed its true
form-a green-skinned giant frog.

The bystanders were startled and grabbed whatever they could use to
attack. The frog kicked the ground with both legs, leaped higher than a
tree, and swiftly fled toward the mountains. In pursuit, the folks arrived at
the marshes, where they witnessed countless small frogs scraping mucus
from each other's bodies, collecting it in a large barrel. They then applied
fragrant powder to themselves, hugging and sniffing each other in sheer
delight.

Silently, the people approached and peered into the barrel. The mucus
inside gleamed with clarity, just like the oil they had favored. At the sight,
they were occupied by bouts of nausea and began to vomit. None had the
strength to pursue and kill guais. All the frogs noticed this and hastily fled,
leaving the marshes filled with a rather unique scene.

## Lang-Li-Guhh-Baw

> With swollen belly, strange skills arise,
> A frog's croaks can summon thunder's cries,
> No loong needed to call the breeze,
> In shallow waters, frogs' songs please.

Here we must speak once more of that wandering Daoist. He passed
through the Kingdom of Hhami, and ever since his encounter with the
frog guai, he had made it his mission to hunt such guais. Far and wide, he
sought their traces.

On a day he came unto a valley where croaks echoed, crackling with eerie
flashes. Joy rose in his heart, and he hastened to the riverbank. There, he
set up a makeshift altar to subdue the yaoguai in the river. Incense and
candles were lit for the offerings; then, with his cap removed and hair
unloosed, the Daoist traced the three seals of power with vermeil cinnabar
and drew the banishing sword. He mumbled and muttered the spells he
knew.

Then his roar shook the air: "Thus be Lord Lao's decree!" With a flash of
his sword, he snatched up a seal and flung it skyward. A plume of flame
flared and vanished. The frog guai in the valley, startled by this
commotion, sprang from the water - a great yellow frog clad in hues
between green and blue, different from the last.

The Daoist, seeing the yaoguai spring forth, swiftly lifted a second seal. It
flared up in a trice, and a raging wind followed. As the third seal caught
light, pealing thunder cracked from the lowering clouds. Both the Daoist
and the yaoguai were startled, hands flying to their heads. As silence fell,
they looked up to see trees blasted and split, while the storm above broke
and scattered.

The Daoist froze, then scrambled to ready his brush for three more seals.
The frog guai, unhurried, drummed its belly. The sky stood unchanged,
but with each stroke, a dozen shafts of golden light lanced down, each
striking close around the Daoist.

Tumbling and rolling, the Daoist could scarcely evade the beams of light.
Then the frog guai gaped its maw and spat out a swarm of electrifying
tadpoles. No matter how the Daoist dodged, they pursued him
relentlessly until he fled in utter rout.

Alas, in matters of renown, it is common to judge power by the intricacy
and grandeur of one's methods. There might be some wisdom in that.

## Earth Wolf

> On moonless nights with winds that cry,
> The time for debts and vengeance nigh,
> In kind yaoguais, place your trust,
> But wicked souls, defy you must.

There was once a general's son who served as a drill master in the barracks.
Cruel and ruthless he was, and the soldiers trembled at his commands.
Yet, out of respect for the general, they bore their resentment in silence.
The drill master, who had a passion for hunting, kept a Chinese Xigou, a

slender hound. One day, he went hunting with several instructors but
returned empty-handed, much to his shame. He blamed the innocent
hound for their failure and had it beaten to death.

The soldiers, who had been ordered to kill the hound, were much
troubled in spirit. They buried the hound in a field behind the barracks,
where many lingzhi mushrooms grew, and gathered at night to chant
sutras for the repose of its soul.

One night, the drill master heard a dog barking outside the barracks. He
sent men to seek out the source of the noise, but the barking ceased each
time they approached, only to resume once they had returned to sleep.
After a few times, the drill master lost his temper and went to investigate
himself. As he stood in the yard, he felt the sound came from beneath the
ground and ordered his men to dig up the earth.

As the soil was cleared away, the hound leaped from the earth, appearing
as it had in life but now adorned with thin tentacles, like the roots of some
peculiar plant. The drill master, thrilled by this rare find, called to the
hound. It recognized its master and bounded joyfully towards him.

However, two hard, antler-like mushrooms had grown upon its head. As
the hound leaped into the drill master's arms, these mushrooms pierced
his chest, and he died then and there.

The soldiers rushed to call the healers, shouting in panic and confusion.
Amid the turmoil, no one thought to catch the hound. Later, no matter
how they searched, they never found a trace of it.

## The Royal Family of Flowing Sands

> A foolish son, a clever father,
> One plans ahead, the other rather.
> On the battlefield, no room for kin,
> The cunning father flees, leaving his son within.

The Kingdom of Flowing Sands had three princes of the royal line.

The eldest prince, favored by the king, was a renowned warrior for his
valor in the battles against the Fuban. He was granted the title of Valiant
General. But later, a shadow darkened his mind, clouding his reason and
erasing his memories of his kin. Thus, he was hidden away.

The king was heartbroken. Luckily, two of his sons yet remained.

The third prince, the youngest and the king's most trusted, was well-
versed in poetry and deeply fond of Buddhist teachings. He possessed
both wisdom and strength. However, when the king issued the Rodent
Reverence Edict and executed those ministers who opposed it, the third
prince left in protest. Wrath consumed the king, but one of his sons still
remained.

The second prince, though a man of great strength, was simple of mind.
He was neither as skilled a warrior as his elder brother nor as clever as his
younger sibling. Of the three sons, he was the least favored by the king.
Nevertheless, he remained by the king's side the longest.

When the Yellow Wind King retrieved a mighty vessel and returned, the
King of Flowing Sands rallied to his banner with what remained of his
people, hoping to reclaim his lost kingdom. The Yellow Wind King, short
on men, saw the fierce spirit in the second prince and welcomed him and
his followers into his ranks.

But the Yellow Wind King had a Tiger Vanguard, whose hunger for rat
flesh required a fresh feast each day. When the Yellow Wind King
retreated into his meditating seclusion, the tiger grew even bolder. Only
the savage might of the second prince's hammer could give him pause
from time to time.

Much did the second prince sacrifice for his father the king, yet through
all the perils and hardships they endured, the King of Flowing Sands never
failed to bring the eldest prince with him and continuously sent minions
to seek out the youngest. What thoughts dwelled in the heart of the
second son, none could say.

![The Royal Family of Flowing Sands](/image-20240827232235481.png)

## First Prince of the Flowing Sands

> Though hairless, strength prevails,
> Sturdy and bold, never frail.
> Madness hides in mountain, where winds sing,
> In dark gutters, reigns as king.

The yellow-furred rat had quelled the calamity caused by Fuban, earning
the king's deep respect and being appointed as the Royal Sage. No matter
the state affairs or the minutiae of daily life, the king would first seek his
counsel.

At the sage's suggestion, the king issued the "Rodent Reverence Edict,"
prompting rodent guais from all around to migrate into the city.
The First Prince, having distinguished himself in battle, was conferred the
title of Brave General and was basking in his success. However, he was
deeply displeased that a guai sage had stolen his shine. Using the pretext of
the rodent guais causing trouble, he rallied court officials to petition for
the Royal Sage's removal.

Several upheavals ensued in the court, resulting in the deaths of many
loyal to the prince, and even the Third Prince left in anger. Yet, the king's
trust in the sage remained unshaken.

On the sage's birthday, the entire kingdom worshiped his statue, and even
the king paid a visit to the Temple of Royal Sage himself to offer incense
and prayers. Unable to contain his fury, the First Prince overturned the
incense table in public.

Such an affront to royal authority could not be tolerated. Enraged, the
king imprisoned the prince. The sage, however, was not angered and even
spoke many good words for the Brave General. Learning of the sage's
intercession, the prince became even more convinced that he was a deeply
scheming evil guai, cursing him incessantly in his cell. The king, upon
hearing this, grew more antagonized by his unruly son. Hence, he decreed
that the prince needed strict discipline, ordering that his meals be
delivered to the cell door thrice daily, with no visitors allowed.

Initially, the prince was very stubborn, but over time, he softened and
began to plead for mercy. Yet, he remained defiant in his heart, constantly
plotting to kill the rodents and avenge himself once he was free.

One day, his meal was late, and he was growing anxious. Then he heard
the sound of a key turning, and the cell door unexpectedly opened.

After waiting for a while and seeing no one enter, he walked out himself.
To his astonishment, the guards and officials bustling about outside were
no longer human. They all became rats dressed in robes.

The prince thought it was that the sage had led the rodent guais to usurp
the throne, and in his panic, he charged into his father's golden hall
A short, stout rat, speaking in his father's voice, called out to him. This
must be an imposter! The prince grabbed a guard's sword and struck at the
king.

Chaos erupted in the hall, only the Royal Sage brought forth a bronze
mirror for the prince to see himself. In the reflection, there was no trace of
the Brave General, only an enormously fat rat.

## Mother of Stones

> As fate aligns, chance plays its part,
> Yet misfortune leaves an empty heart.
> Judge not a hero by skill alone,
> But by the fortune that they have shown.

Long ago in the Yellow Wind Ridge there lived two mountain deities. By
the grace of a wise one, they came into possession of a great yaoguai's
inner pill.

They split and consumed it, gaining great powers from within.
Thenceforth, they bore the shape and heart of humans. In gratitude, they
bent their newfound strength to make the mountain's wilds thrive for the
wise one.

The Keeper of the mountain, however, received no share of this boon.
Envy wormed its way into his heart upon learning that the deities could
conjure rock guais at will. He schemed to wrest this power for himself.

Little did he know, their conjurations drained deeply from their own Will.
The mountain deities poured out their own power to birth rock guais, who
shaped crag and stone, and nurtured green and bloom.

Day by day, the Keeper of the mountain sought to pilfer their practice and
cultivation through low deceits. Then came a day when a great rock guai
emerged, and the lesser guais bowed to him as their Vanguard. Still, the
Keeper, heedless of his peril, provoked strife as he had done before. Blow
after blow, the Stone Vanguard rained upon him until he lay pummeled in
the dirt. Even then, he did not cease hurling curses.

Alas, those who are bent on wickedness find few obstacles in their path,
while those who pursue virtue encounter many hardships, often set by
those with ill intentions.

## Tiger's Acolyte

> Where has the swordsman gone, with tears in his eyes?
> The wild wind sweeps the northern sands, lonely and desolate skies.
> Grass visits the empty village huts, dust welcomes the evil guais.
> Who knows the bitterness of the lotus heart, or the sourness within the
> pear's guise?

There was once a swordsman, wild and free, who roamed the lands far and
wide. For the love of a woman, he forsook his wandering ways, married,
and had a child.

But their happiness proved fleeting. From the mountains beyond the city
walls, there arose a wind, fierce and full of malice. It whipped the yellow
dust into a frenzy, and the city was choked with it, day after day. Soon, his
wife succumbed to a wasting sickness, and their child, too, became ill.

The man was devastated. He spent all his silver in a vain attempt to heal his
child. Then he heard ofa bodhisattva on New Mount Sumeru who could

cure the wind-sickness. With haste, he gathered what he still had and set
forth with his child.

When he reached New Mount Sumeru, the disciples told him that the
bodhisattva had departed for Yellow Wind Ridge long ago and had not
returned. The man had no choice but to take his child and set out once
more.

When they arrived at the ridge, they learned that this place was right next
to the fierce wind. The child's frail condition worsened with each passing
hour. They took shelter in the village of Windrest, where the child rested
and the man went to find the bodhisattva.

One day, while passing a dry well outside the village, the man heard a
tiger's roar. He climbed down into the well and found a hidden cavern,
where a great tiger lay, wounded and weak, deep in meditation.

The tiger told the man he was a deity in the mountain, revered by the
village priests. In the valley, they had even raised a temple in his honor. He
said he'd been ambushed by the yaoguai that stirred up the fierce wind
and took over his temple. That's why he was in this pitiful state.

The man was doubtful, but as he asked around in the village, he found that
the tale was true in every detail, from the reverence of the priests to the
temple in the valley. He hastened back to the well, his ailing child in his
arms, to beg the tiger for healing.

The tiger brought out a strangely shaped gourd, filled it with water, and
gave it to the child. Wonder of wonders, after drinking from the gourd,
the child was able to run and play as he had before the wind sickness
struck.

The tiger told the man that the wind had harmed his essence. With the
flesh of the living, he could regain his former might, and then he could
tame the raging wind and heal the child completely.

The man was reluctant, but as he watched his son grow stronger day by
day, playing in the village with the other children, a terrible resolve
hardened in his heart. He began to lead the unsuspecting villagers into the
well, hoping to restore the tiger to its former strength.

As time passed, most naturally, the villagers found out what he had done.
By the time the man returned to the village, he found his son slain by their
angry hands.

The man was consumed by regret and drew the sword he had sealed away
for years. He fell upon the villagers, and one by one, he cut them down,
until the streets ran red with blood. Then, alone, he set out into the
shifting sandstorm, lost in the ever-howling wind.

![Tigers Acolyte](/image-20240827232354987.png)

## Gore-Eye Daoist

> A strange man with a lump on his back,
> And a staff of blood-red hue,
> He leaps and bounds with eerie might,
> A hundred eyes glowing in the night.

A strange visitor once came to the Temple of Yellow Flowers.

He proclaimed himself trained in the mystic arts upon the Mount Lingtai.
"Submit now and yield to me the thing" he told the master of the temple,
"and you will be spared." Beetle Commander was sent to subdue him, and
the man was sealed in a cocoon sack in the cave. Yet days later, a lesser
guai brought word to the master that the sack lay sundered, and the
captive had escaped. At this, the master gave nothing but a smile.

Since his escape from the cocoon sack, a fleshy mess studded with many
eyes had sprouted from the man's back. He paid no mind to this horrific
sight and continued his wandering practice.

He passed through a desolate mountain where bandits ran rampant and
the nearby villagers lived in squalor. Here he chose to settle and
summoned rainfall. By his arts, the blasted peaks grew green with elms
and willows, and the slopes cloaked themselves in pines and firs.

After his efforts, the once-barren mountain saw years of clement weather,
and the people of the lowlands flourished in number. Yet the bandits
cared nothing for an honest life. They saw the greenwood only as fresh
plunder and the growing number as ripe for the hunt. The man then took
on the guise of an enlightened monk and went among the bandits'
hideout to spread the wisdom of the Buddha. In the end, even the bandits
forsook evil and came down the mountain to live in peace.

Years passed. Then came a day when the man entered the village and
raised a ritual staff at the entrance. From its crown poured a blood-red
light. Every person it touched fell into a frenzy, tearing at each other as if
under the thrall of some evil force.

In mere moments, the lowlands became a pit of slaughter, and the ground
overflowed with the blood of the slain.

On the man's back, the hump gaped wide with countless eyes unveiled.
Slowly, they supped the spilled blood and sundered spirits. In no time, the
lump had swollen even larger, until it could absorb no more. Only then
did the eyes slowly close.

The man came back to himself and removed the staff. He then set out for
the next place to settle.

## Mad Tiger

> Yellow wind invades the land, brothers turn to strife,
> Father's vengeance left unclaimed, in the well of life.
> Roaring through the mountain pass, a heart that feigns to care,
> Actions always half-complete, dreams and life laid bare.

One day, the brother of Tiger Vanguard was practicing his roaring
technique at the bottom of a well when he saw someone climbing down
the vines. Seeing that the intruder had some courage, he refrained from
attacking and instead inquired about his purpose.

The man explained that he was seeking a Bodhisattva to cure his son's
wind illness, but he failed, and now his son was on the brink of death.
Hearing this, Tiger Brother devised a plan. He attributed his elder
brother's deeds to himself and convinced the man to bring his son,
claiming he could treat the boy.

When they first met, the boy's face was pale. Too weak to climb down the
well by himself, the boy was carried by his father by tying him with a hemp
rope to lower him safely into the well. Tiger Brother examined the boy and
confirmed that his spirit had been disturbed by the Samadhi Wind.
Without stopping the wind and sand, no one could cure him.

Tiger Brother remembered that his brother had given him a magical
gourd. Drinking from it could strengthen one's vitality, and he thought it
might keep the boy alive.

After the boy drank the water Tiger Brother gave him, he indeed regained
some energy and could speak. Despite his long illness, the boy was very
polite. He thanked Tiger Brother for his help, praising him endlessly. In
the boy's admiring gaze, Tiger Brother found a long-lost sense of
satisfaction. He instructed the father and son to come daily to take a sip
from the gourd, or the boy would relapse.

After several visits, the boy's condition improved significantly. He could
walk around and even play in the village, making many friends. Each time
he came to drink from the gourd, he would call Tiger Brother "Tiger God"
and share his new food, toys, and experiences.

Despite his initial wariness of the father and son, Tiger Brother gave the
boy his gourd when he observed that the man was sincere and honest. He
instructed the boy to keep the gourd close. Heeding his words, the boy's
health improved even more.

Yet, abruptly, the father and son stopped visiting. Tiger Brother waited for
several days, thinking they might have run off with the gourd. Determined
to find out what happened, he went to the village.

Upon entering the village, he saw blood everywhere; the villagers had
been slaughtered. At the village entrance, there was a thin coffin, and
inside lay the boy's body. He still wore the gourd Tiger Brother had given
him around his neck. Judging by the wounds, it seemed he had been
beaten to death with sticks.

Tiger Brother carried the coffin back to the bottom of the well. He decided
to wait until he was strong enough. One day, he would stop that cursed
wind and sand..

![Mad Tiger](/image-20240827232435573.png)

## Tiger Vanguard

> Gathering strength with a mighty roar,
> Transforming stones, launching surprise once more.
> A loyal general with a heart so bold,
> A noble fighter, lost in the age of old.

The Tang Monk and his two disciples pressed on. Before half a day had
passed, they came upon a towering peak, dire to behold. As they gazed
upon it, there arose a tumult of wind, and from the mountainside leaped a
tiger, dappled and fierce, its tail lashing in the wind. "I am no common
beast!" it roared. "I am the Vanguard of the Yellow Wind King. By order of
my liege, I patrol this range and seek out mortals to serve as side dishes for
his brews."

The yaoguai closed in with a flurry of claws aimed at Bajie's face. Wukong
whipped out his staff with a shout, "Take him!"

Bajie rallied his courage, and the yaoguai fell back in disarray. Panicked, it
sloughed off its skin and draped it over a tiger-shaped rock. Loosed from
its flesh, it transformed into a screaming gale and raced back to the
mountain road. And there, it found the Tang Monk chanting his sutra. In a
trice, the tiger seized the monk and bore him away on the wind. The tiger
brought the monk to the mouth of a cave and, stilling the wind, spoke to
the guard, "Tell this to our master; the Tiger Vanguard has captured a
monk and awaits the king's decision at the gate."

The guard rushed in to report. Out came two tiger cubs who hailed the
vanguard as their father and made their courtesies. The older cub asked,
"Where did you find this pale-faced monk?" The vanguard laughed."A
stroke of luck! I was patrolling the mountain and chanced upon him." The
younger cub, overjoyed, said: "Well done, Father! Teach me how you did
it someday."

Even as they spoke, the master of the cave sent word: "Bring him in."
Along with his sons, the Tiger Vanguard presented the Tang Monk before
his master. "My king," the vanguard began, "I was honored with your
command to patrol the mountain. By chance, I came across a monk, none
other than the Tang emperor's sworn brother Tang Monk, bound for a
journey to the West to seek the scriptures. I seized him and now offer him
to grace your table." The master, surprised, demanded the full tale. The
vanguard knelt to one side and recounted the fight.

"Hold," said the cave master. "We do not eat him just yet." The vanguard
protested: "My king! It is against our nature to refuse the food before us."
But his master replied: "You do not understand. Eating him would be no
great matter, but I fear the two disciples of his will come clamoring at our
gate. It is safest to bind him to the windrest post in our rear garden. Wait
three days, or five; if his disciples do not come to our gate, we will boil,
steam, fry, or roast him at our leisure. There is no rush." The vanguard
rejoiced. "Wise beyond measure, my king! Wise indeed."

The two young tigers followed their father out. The elder muttered,
"Master has always devoured mortals without a second thought. There
should be something he left unsaid." The younger added: "He seems
almost... afraid of that mortal." Their father snapped: "You know nothing
of the powers of our master! Long seasons have I served him. How could
he shrink before any other?" The brothers exchanged glances but said no
more.

Scarcely half a day had passed when the master sent for them again. It was
Sun Wukong challenging upon their gate. The Tiger Vanguard requested
to face him, but the master demurred, "1 fear you cannot prevail against
him. You may well be wounded, and you must not then impute blame
unto me." The vanguard's sons urged him to reconsider, but he paid them
no heed. "Rest assured, you! Wait only until I return!"

## Captain Lotus-Vision

> "All things are by nature void... There is no wax or wane."

For pride and arrogance, your golden form is shattered.
From the rift shines Buddha's light, majestic and boundless.
With the glaring rays, flashing, startling, breaking,
You forget the teachings and fall into the false.

You are alone, isolated, crippled,
Dancing, prancing, like a deity or ghost, no less.
Here the wise go mad, the brave turn bad, the kind face duress.
Tainted by worldly dust, your practice is in a mess.

May your body enlighten the world and
Quell your proud and overbearing, merging light and darkness.

## Captain Void-Illusion

> "Contemplating the myriad forms, returning to the essence of nature."

With arrogance ablaze, his limbs torn,
You boasted of truth, a thousand hands adorned.
Yet the void illusion deceived and beguiled,
Mourned and lamented, your spirit defiled.
With bonds severed, in nirvana you were exiled.

In silence, in solitude, in tranquillity,
How painful it was to face death in clarity.
Detached from bitterness and pain,
Blessed, your flesh and blood through resentment shall remain.

May you cease the debate of falsehood and truth,
As the tide rises, cleansing with its mighty soothe.

## Captain Kalpa-Wave

> Within a flick of the finger, lotus flowers bloom and wither.

Thought yourself mighty, yet ended up headless.
From your blood and pus, lotus flowers bloom restless.
Coaxed, enticed, and stabbed, by the words of auspiciousness,
Your link to Buddha's wisdom severed, your mind lost in the incense dust,
breathless.

The truest of the truth, the kindest in kindness, and the fairest in fairness,
you sought and lost,
Principles shattered, head twisted, and body crossed.
Tenderness forsaken you, your uprights exhaust,
Eyes clouded, stars dimmed in frost.

May your body bring prosperity and
The red lotus thrives in hostility.

## Apramana Bat

> Dwelling in a Buddha's form,
> With wings to ride the wind's storm.
> An iron heart, through toil it sings,
> A golden shell, in splendor it springs.

Years ago, in mountains remote, there was a small temple built by the local
villagers. The temple was unattended, housing only a black statue, with
dried lamps and an empty censer.

One day, a wandering swordsman passed by and decided to spend the
night in the temple before continuing his journey. As he was drifting off to
sleep, he suddenly heard the sound of wind behind him. Opening his eyes
slightly, he saw the statue on the altar sprout wings and take flight. The
creature had scythe-like claws on its feet. Terrified, the swordsman
quickly rolled over, drew his sword, and engaged in a fierce battle with the
statue, eventually slaying it.

The next morning, the villagers gathered outside the temple, bringing
flowers and wine to thank the swordsman for ridding them of the yaoguai.
They explained that many such temples in the mountains were inhabited
by these yaoguai disguised as statues and asked the swordsman to
eliminate them all. Seeing the villagers had brought a great deal of silver,
greed overtook him, and he agreed, asking them to lead the way.

Surrounded by the villagers, who praised and urged him on, the
swordsman was led deep into the forest to a larger ancient temple. As soon
as he entered the hall, he saw incense burning high and candles glowing
brightly. On the altar sat a larger statue, similar in appearance to the one
he had killed before, but coated in gold, with a particularly majestic and
imposing presence. Sensing danger, the swordsman tried to flee, but the
statue took flight, flapping its wings to unleash a frosty wind that froze
him in place.

Watching the golden statue used its hooked claws to pierce the
swordsman's shoulders and drag him into the back of the temple, the
villagers all knelt and made their wishes. The next day, everything they
had wished for appeared at their doorsteps.

## Lang-Li-Guhh-Lang

> Unafraid of the northern chill
> With skin like jade, it loves the thrill.
> Mist turns to frost and snow,
> In icy play, its spirit grows.

Picking up from where we left off, that Daoist who had fled in disgrace
spent several years in secluded meditation in the mountains, mastering
the Five Thunder Technique until he could wield it with perfect ease.
Confident in his abilities, he set out once more.

During his journey, he captured a small electric tadpole and confined it
within his gourd. As he passed through the snowy mountains, the tadpole
began to stir restlessly inside the gourd, signaling the presence of a frog
guai nearby. Following the signs, he arrived at a deep, icy pool in a valley
and indeed found a giant frog, covered in frost and lying dormant by the
shore.

Without hesitation, the Daoist unleashed a thunderbolt at the frog,
expecting it to be struck down instantly. To his surprise, the frog leaped
high into the air and dodged the attack. Unperturbed, the Daoist cast
another thunderbolt, but the frog evaded it again, hopping closer with
each leap. Learnt from the past, the Daoist retreated several steps,
thinking himself clever. However, to his surprise, the frog stood on its
hind legs, puffed out its chest, lunged forward, and knocked the Daoist off
balance with its large belly. As he prepared to strike back, the frog opened
its mouth and blew a gust of icy wind, freezing him in place.

Just as the frog was about to devour him, a group of monks appeared from
the other side of the pool. Seeing the Daoist frozen there, they drove the
frog guai away, narrowly saving his life.

## Old Ginseng Guai

> Scatters o'er the mountain's crest,
> Rich soil births, dews of the best.
> Seven ounces common, eight ounces rare,
> A slight difference, fortunes lay bare.

This story was told by a pharmacist in the city, and it concerns a secret
about his cousin's family.

The cousin's ancestors were originally ginseng gatherers in the
mountains. For some unknown reason, they abandoned their old craft and
became woodcutters.

Although the family was not wealthy, everyone lived long lives.
From a young age, the cousin often saw a shabby, unkempt old man
visiting their home. Whenever he came, the family would prepare a lavish
meal and fine wine for him to enjoy alone. At the time, the cousin despised
the old man, thinking he was a freeloading drunkard who seldom spoke
and often caused trouble when drunk.

One day, the old man visited again for a drink while the cousin's great-
grandmother fell gravely ill with typhoid fever, seemingly on the brink of
death. Upon hearing about her critical condition, the old man went into
the courtyard, reached into the ground with both hands, and out crawled
numerous vines. Among the vines grew a small seedling that quickly
matured, blossomed, and bore fruit. The old man pulled it out, revealing a
Millennium Ginseng. After the great-grandmother drank the ginseng
soup, she miraculously recovered and remains healthy to this day.

It was on that day that the cousin seemed to come to a realization and
began to treat the old man with great respect, as if he were a member of
the family.

The cousin once invited the pharmacist to move to the mountains and live
with him, but the pharmacist flatly refused.

The pharmacist explained,"Although your family enjoys longevity, they
live on bland meals every day, and life in deep mountains are too lonely. I
still prefer to live in the city. Hence, I cannot go with you."

Just take the story as a fun anecdote.

![Old Ginseng Guai](/image-20240827232938875.png)

## Non-White

> A jester's face with powder white,
> A cunning form, both sly and slight.
> Boldly plays the leading role,
> Yet remains an actor, lost in the whole.

In the Village of Tuoluo, there was a small opera troupe of about a dozen
members. Watching their performances was considered the most
luxurious entertainment within miles.

Among the troupe was an actor who specialized in playing the jester. He
always painted his face white, and the villagers would snicker whenever
they saw him. The jester was deeply frustrated. Since childhood, he had
dreamed of playing a heroic role on stage. To join the troupe, he had
worked as an unpaid servant for the troupe leader for a year. He trained
tirelessly, regardless of the weather or his health. Yet, he ended up being
the subject of ridicule.

The jester suggested a role switch. However, everyone said he lacked the
righteous aura needed for such a heroic role.
Disbelieving their words, the jester took on the role of the hero without
notifying the cast during the performance, and beat up the hero on stage.
The audience was furious; they destroyed the stage and left without
paying.

The jester was condemned by the troupe, while the beaten hero was
comforted. In a fit of rage, the troupe leader expelled the jester from the
group. Despite much reflection, the jester couldn't understand why he
suffered such reprimand. Eventually, he concluded that it was his
appearance that was the problem. Thus, with two poisoned daggers, he
waited in an alley and killed the hero actor. He peeled the man's face and
wore it, hoping to take over his life.

The next day, when it was time for the hero to appear on stage, the jester,
wearing the actor's face, stepped forward and sang passionately.
Initially, the audience was deceived, but later they were horrified.
Believing the jester had gone mad, they tied him up and sent him to a
temple a thousand miles away for seclusion. Upon seeing him, the abbot of
the temple was overjoyed. He named the jester "Non- White" and even
created a unique practicing technique combining poison and frost for
him.

The abbot told him that a Destined One would come and help him master
the technique, and he could become a true hero if he could wear the face
of the Destined One.

From the day on, no one dared to walk the mountain path guarded by
Non-White, fearing they might encounter him wearing someone else's
face.

![Non-White](/image-20240827233000745.png)

## Non-Pure

> A wide heart, a plump form, a belly so grand,
> A fierce look, drooping lips, a visage unplanned.
> Steadfast as a mountain, he stays still,
> From toils, he hides, guarding the temple's hill.

In the vast sky, snowflakes drifted down, covering the exquisite palaces
and towers, and blanketing the mountain ridge year after year without
ceasing for a moment. In stark contrast to this relentless snow, Non-Pure
was someone who constantly sought to shirk his duties and laze around.
One day, while Non-Pure was on guard in the side hall, ready to respond
to his master's call at any moment, he heard the sounds of a fight outside.
Thunder Rhino Master came running to report that some unknown
yaoguai from the mountains was trying to force his way in to see their
master.

Non-Pure nonchalantly replied, "You go out and deal with him first. I'll
grab my spade and join you shortly." After Thunder Rhino Master left the
side hall, Non-Pure sat back down on his meditation cushion, reclining
lazily. Outside, the yaoguai loudly demanded to see the Buddha of the
Future and to become his disciple, while the sounds of the fight grew
more intense.

Thunder Rhino Master returned to ask for help again. Non-Pure stood up
and said, "You and the two overlords hold him off. Don't let him in. My
spade's blade is a bit dull; I'll come once I've sharpened it." After a while,
the noise outside quieted down. Thunder Rhino Master came back to
report that the yaoguai seeking guidance had been accidentally killed by
the overlords.

Non-Pure praised, "You did well. Throw the body into the dry well so it
doesn't dirty this place." Hearing this, Thunder Rhino Master sighed
inwardly, lamenting the yaoguai's ill fate. If another brother had been on
guard, perhaps the yaoguai might have actually met their master.

Unexpectedly, when discarding the body, Thunder Rhino Master
discovered that the yaoguai had talismans for summoning fire and
lightning stuck to his body, indicating he had come seeking revenge
against their master. At this news, Thunder Rhino Master was both
shocked and secretly relieved.

## Non-Able

> Amidst the snow, a monk so strange,
> Before the wall, in northern winds' range.
> With martial arts, he seeks true Zen,
> Bind his hands, but not his spirit then.

Non-Able was unmatched in his martial arts skills, with no one in the
temple able to rival him.

One day, Yellowbrow summoned him and offered to teach him some
skills. However, Non-Able replied, "Master, I believe my martial arts are
sufficient to overcome any foe. There is no need for other skills."

Yellowbrow laughed and said, "Your straightforward approach shows a
lack of adaptability. How can you progress further if you bind yourself in
such a way?"

Non-Able responded, "Master, if I use methods I do not believe in to
achieve victory, even if I win in the end, I will still feel like I did not win
the fight and unable."

Yellowbrow asked,"Do you not agree with your master's path?"
Non-Able replied, "Master, you have always taken the clever route, which
is why it is difficult for you to attain Buddhahood. It seems you can do
everything, but in reality, you can do nothing."

Non-Able chuckled softly at this and ordered Non-Able hands to be tied
behind his back, instructing him to reflect on his actions in front of the
stone wall outside the temple. He thought that after a few days of
kneeling, Non-Able would let go of his stubbornness. However, Non-Able
remained resolute and, to this day, refuses to bow his head.

![Non-Able](/image-20240827233048287.png)

## Non-Void

> Neither dead nor truly alive, a dreamer left behind,
> One step missed, cost half a lifetime.

Few disciples know when Non- Void took his vows and became a monk.
They only know that he was among the earliest to follow their master,
making him the most senior, and entrusted to many of the temple's affairs.

He rarely left the hall, seemingly always engrossed in endless sutra
recitations. He was also highly skilled in poetry and painting, having
depicted various Buddhas in the west and the myriad aspects of worldly
life. Yet, he never cherished his creations, often discarding them carelessly
after finishing. When asked why, he would say, "I see no true self; Non-
void is but void. It's all an illusion, so why hold on to it?"

Though Non-Void seldom left the hall, he enjoyed engaging others in
debates about Buddhist doctrines.

One day, Non-Able approached him and asked, "Brother, is killing a sin?"

Non-Void replied, "Killing is a sin. But if it is for the sake of the greater
good, then it is not a sin."

Non-Able countered, "And what is the greater good?"

Non-Void answered, "It is the realization of void, the fulfillment of virtue,
ascending to the land of bliss."

Non-Able questioned further, "Killing not only fails to resolve karma but
also creates more entanglements and obstacles. How can one ascend to
bliss then?"

Non-Void responded, "If I do not enter hell, who will? If not killing leaves
harm for others, isn't that a greater lack of virtue?"

Non-Able laughed, "Brother, you yourself said you would enter hell,
which shows that killing is wrong no matter what. Good ones naturally
receive blessings; there's no need for you to make things complicated."

Non-Void hastily explained, "Entering hell is just a metaphor. The essence
is to suffer for others..."

Non-Able interrupted, "Nonsense! Killing is killing, no need for all these
convoluted justifications. Brother, the pretence behind justifying killing is
the real sin.."

Hearing this, Non-Void was momentarily speechless, as if reminded of
something from the past.

From that day on, the two never debated again.

## Monk from the Sea

> Bitter Lake's expanse, no end in sight,
> The ferry of enlightenment, he sought day and night.
> Low means may tempt, but yield no gain,
> True greatness takes flight, in honor's domain.

Years ago, Yellowbrow crossed the Bitter Lake on a towered ferry. Upon
disembarking, he discovered some strange fish clinging to the ship's hull.
These fish, known as He Luo, had a single head but ten bodies, making
them bizarre and fearsome.

When the fish saw Yellowbrow approaching, they wondrously bowed and
made noises, indicating their desire to follow him and escape the Bitter
Lake. Yellowbrow laughed and said, "With your strange forms, others
would surely reject you. But I find it interesting to take in what ordinary
people would not." With that, he accepted these strange fish as his
disciples, clothed them, and taught them how to read and transform into
human forms. He even allowed them to practice freely within the realm of
the New West.

One of the fish guais was particularly robust and had a fierce
temperament. After mastering some techniques, it would ambush at
various spots in the temple, waiting for opportunities to attack
Yellowbrow when he went out, striking without mercy. Yellowbrow,
however, enjoyed these encounters and would seriously engage in
combat with the fish guai. Most of the time, he would simply sweep it out
of the hall with a swing of his Spikeshaft Cudgel.

Despite repeated defeats, the fish guai realized that close combat was
futile. It independently devised a technique involving throwing snowballs
with its limbs, hitting targets with uncanny accuracy. Once, in the Forest
of Felicity, even Yellowbrow was hit several times by snowballs, nearly
freezing into an ice block.

Instead of getting angry, Yellowbrow was delighted and unprecedentedly
bestowed a new title upon the He Luo fish guai"Monk from the Sea." He
then assigned it the task of cleaning the inner courtyard, which
conveniently allowed it to ambush anyone it wished to, especially
Yellowbrow himself.

Ah, though they followed the same master, the disciples' experiences and
purposes in their practice varied greatly, leading to vastly different
treatments.

![Monk from the Sea](/image-20240827233131633.png)

## Macaque Chief

> Once chief among the ranks, his countenance dark,
> In crimson silk pants, a striking mark.
> With icy blows, he mocks their plight,
> A jesting whiff, his foes left in a fright.

The Macaque Chief knelt with his back hunched, folding his dark wings
before the golden Buddha statue at the feet of Yellowbrow.

Yellowbrow raised his hand, pinching the feathers, and said, "Such crude
methods... The one who dared to use them on you monkeys was truly
ignorant of the ways of the world." With that, he waved his Spineshaft
Cudgel, and specks of Will poured over the Macaque Chief, shining like
the galaxy. The black wings trembled and retracted back into the monkey's
body. The Macaque Chief was stunned, and reached to touch his back,
overjoyed.

Yellowbrow laughed heartily, "You were a chief under Sun Wukong. Now
that he is dead, you need not wander anymore. I am rebuilding the New
Thunderclap Temple to save all from suffering. Why not stay here?"
Seeing the Macaque Chief hesitate, Yellowbrow continued,"1 know you
have endured much hardship. To rank among the high, one must first toil
among the low. You have already been low and toiled. Now, join me, and
my teachings will elevate you among the highest."

The Macaque Chief scratched his head, seeming tempted. Yellowbrow
added, "In this world, the weak are often oppressed, while the strong act
with impunity. The suffering you endured was ultimately due to a lack of
power. Think about it, if you had the abilities of that monkey who wreaked
such havoc in the Celestial Palace, it would have been others who would
have suffered."

Recalling the bitterness and hardships of the past years, the Macaque Chief
couldn't help but shed tears. He quickly prostrated himself at the feet of
the fat monk, kowtowing repeatedly.

Yellowbrow laughed heartily, unfastened the sack at his waist, and placed
the Macaque Chief inside. "Very well. I will teach you now," he said.

## The Sixth Sister

> In hidden groves, a home appears,
> Laughter fills the path with flowers near.
> Girl chases the butterflies in flight,
> As rumors fade like shooting stars in the night.

In the Webbed Hollow, there were no children of the same age as the
Sixth Sister. She usually spent her time with her elder sisters, who were all
very nice to her. Only the fourth sister would strictly supervise her
training. Sometimes, when she trained diligently, the fourth sister would
take her to the mountain top to gaze at the scenery outside and tell her
stories about the world beyond the mountains.

Although she enjoyed following her fourth sister, the fourth sister often
went into the mountains to investigate secrets unknown to her. Claiming
it was dangerous, she refused to take her along, which left the Sixth Sister
feeling bored.

One day, a flower-viewing banquet was held in the mountains, and the
lesser yaoguais from Mount Wushan came to deliver gifts. As usual, after
completing their tasks, they were invited to stay and drink.

The elder sisters were busy entertaining guests and taking care of their
mother, so the Sixth Sister wandered off on her own. The steward guai,
unable to refuse her, had to accompany her around the cave for a while.

Two drunken pig guais saw the Sixth Sister and pointed at her, saying, "Is
that the one?" The other pig guai replied, "Yes, that's the one."

Feeling annoyed by their comments, the Sixth Sister retorted, "Why are
you pig guais pointing at me? Where are your manners? And what did you
mean for'this' and 'that'?"

The steward guai tried to signal the pig guais to shut up, but they
continued, "Little girl, let us tell you a secret that everyone knows but
you."

The steward guai quickly tried to intervene, but the Sixth Sister earnestly
said, "Go ahead."

The two pig guais laughed and said,"Your father is a pig, just like us. You
are a relative of our old pig family."

Contrary to their expectations, the little girl didn't burst in anger or throw
a tantrum. Instead, she pouted and spoke with a dismissive tone, saying,
"You must be attempting to establish a connection with me because you
lack skill in your craft and seek to exploit me. The one my mother chose
would never be someone as despicable as you."

Hearing this, the pig guais felt embarrassed and never dared to joke at her
again.

![The Sixth Sister](/image-20240827233206335.png)

## The Fifth Sister

> Orioles are charming, swallows love to play,
> Sisters close in bond, let them not be swayed by worldly fray.

The fifth daughter of the Zhu family, in the prime of her youth, was
renowned for her stunning beauty.

One night, dark clouds obscured the moon, and a chilly wind swept over
the ridge, signaling an impending storm. The fifth sister was
accompanying her second sister in the village, overseeing the work of the
lesser yaoguais, when she spotted a traveling scholar seeking shelter from
the rain. Feeling mischievous, she decided to play a trick on him.

The scholar, being somewhat naive, was worried about his bookcase
getting soaked and rushed into the deserted village without noticing the
yaoguais. He barely made it inside, bolted the door, and lit an oil lamp just
as the rain began to pour heavily outside.

Gazing at the rain through the window, the scholar was inspired to recite
poetry: "Xu's land in turmoil, the court in disarray, Like thunderclaps in
clear skies, they sway....

A clap of thunder roared. The scholar thought he saw the window shake
but paid it no mind until he finished reciting, feeling refreshed. It was
then he realized someone was knocking at his door.

As he finished the line, he noticed the window lattice move again.
Assuming it was the wind and rain, he hurriedly shut the window. After
finishing his poem, feeling refreshed, he suddenly realized someone was
knocking at the door.

He caught a glimpse of a graceful silhouette on the door's paper screen,
and a sense of alarm washed over him as he entertained the thought that it
could be a yaoguai. However, considering his own wretched and
unremarkable existence, he somehow found solace in the idea of
becoming a victim of beauty.

As the scholar hurriedly got up and flung the door open, expecting to see
the stunning yaoguai, he was instead met with a horrifying sighta ghost
with disheveled hair and pus-filled eyes. Overwhelmed with terror, he let
out a scream and instinctively pushed past her, desperate to escape the
haunted house.

Outside the door, the fifth daughter, playing with her delicate fingers,
leaned gracefully against the wall, only to be knocked off balance. Angrily,
she walked into the house, cursing the scholar for his rudeness, and
happened to see an old bronze mirror on the desk. Picking it up, she
found out that the storm had washed away her makeup, leaving her face a
patchwork of colors, and with her wet hair covering it, she looked truly
frightening. Even she couldn't help but laugh.

![The Fifth Sister](/image-20240827233230014.png)

## The Fourth Sister

> Sword raised to the azure sky,
> Enemy blood stains the black robe high.
> Fortunate to be a maiden fair,
> Outshining heroes with grace and flair.

In the old days, the Scorpionlord brought his four sons to the Temple of
Yellow Flowers, seeking refuge. The Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master,
coveting the power of his venom, promised to arrange marriages between
the young spider yaoguais and the scorpion princes. Hence, he called
forth Violet Spider and four of her daughters to meet them.

Once everyone was seated, the Daoist Master asked the princes to
introduce themselves one by one.

The eldest prince stood up, thumping his chest, and declared, "My skills
were personally taught by my father. Among my brothers, I am the best
bachelor. If all the sisters wish to marry me, don't let it cause any discord."

Seeing the sisters frown, the second prince quickly stood up and
interjected, "Sisters, please forgive my brother's recklessness. Strong as he
is, which I admit, I am no less capable. If you choose me as your husband, I
will expand our domain and make it prosperous."

The Daoist Master was displeased by the second prince's ambition, and the
sisters too remained non-committal, turning their gaze to the third
scorpion son. Feeling the pressure of their stares, he reluctantly said,"My
brothers are all skilled, and my younger brother is also exceptional. Sisters,
please consider carefully before making a choice."

The fourth prince, disdainful of his third brother's lack of confidence,
said, "My third brother is a bit awkward in temperament. I hope you don't
mind. Although I am younger, my future is promising. Choosing me is
choosing the future."

After hearing their self-introductions, the Daoist master asked the four
daughters of the Zhu family to express their opinions one by one. The
eldest sister spoke gently, "With many sisters to look after, and our
mother's illness, I cannot lay down this burden and let my sisters suffer.
My marriage can wait a few more years."

The scorpions shook their heads, expressing regret. The second sister
laughed coquettishly and said, "I am busy managing the family business
alone, with many financial gaps to fill. If any of you are willing to help
bridge these gaps, I might consider marriage."

The Scorpionlord's mountain had long since fallen into ruin, with no
wealth to speak of, so the second sister's words effectively ended the
conversation. The third sister, holding a fan, said, "I wish to marry
someone with whom I can live in harmony. I love the poetry of Luo Yin.
Have any of you read his works?"

It's likely that the four princes didn't even know what poetry was, let
alone who Luo Yin was. Consequently, everyone pinned their hopes on
the fourth sister.

Sitting at the end, the fourth sister hummed softly out ofboredom before
speaking. "My sisters, you were too polite, speaking so tactfully that they
probably didn't even understand. This so-called meeting is just a scheme
against us. We would end up with no gain, while they take our dowries
and positions in our cave. How dare they consider us as the ones to be
taken advantage of? They call themselves princes, yet none of them are
noble. If they truly had any skills, why not earn their own fortunes instead
of showing off and making fools of themselves here?"

After the fourth sister's outburst, the conversation at the table shifted to
criticizing her. Though apologies were exchanged, the topic of marriage
was never brought up again.

![The Fourth Sister](/image-20240827233253209.png)

## The Third Sister

> In seclusion for a hundred springs,
> Truth and falsehood, the mountain brings.
> Rosy face turns into grey hair,
> Love stories seldom end fair.

The third daughter of the Zhu family, graceful in demeanor and gentle in
nature, loved reading and writing. Observing that her younger sisters
were still naive, and her two elder sisters were extremely busy, she
focused on needlework and became the best weaver in the family.

The fabric shop run by the second sister outside used weaving patterns
designed by the third sister. The weavers in the cave were also trained by
her. Due to her gentle and kind-hearted nature, she often found it
difficult to command the yaoguais. Thus, the fifth sister became her best
assistant. While the third sister taught with the weaving patterns in hand,
the fifth sister followed with a punishing ruler. If any weaver was
particularly unruly, the straightforward fifth sister would report them to
the second sister, who would then seal the offender in a cocoon to be used
as food.

Because the eldest and second sisters were often preoccupied with
various affairs, the fifth sister had been following the third sister since
childhood. The third sister was very quiet, so the fifth sister became her
lively counterpart. The two sisters bickered and quarreled, but it made the
days pass more easily.

Among the books the third sister often read were those strange mortal
anecdote. She always found them fascinating and longed to experience
those romantic scenes depicted. However, she was too wise to fall for any
romantic scholar, knowing that most yaoguais in those stories met tragic
ends.

![The Third Sister](/image-20240827233311216.png)

## The Second Sister

> With powdered face and hair in a twist,
> A slender waist adorned with jade amidst.
> As charming as a maiden from the skies,
> Yet most formidable when she vies.

The second daughter of the Zhu family was raised as a boy from a young
age. She managed the finances and trade for the cave. Due to her
straightforward and generous nature, she had the most interactions with
the stewards outside the mountain and the lesser yaoguais in the Village of
Lanxi.

Because she was busy with numerous affairs, the lesser yaoguais had fixed
times to report and offer tributes to her. Most of these yaoguais, who were
on good terms with her, both respected and feared her. They believed that
their capable and strong-willed lady might one day become the lady of the
cave. If that happened, anyone fortunate enough to marry into the family
could become a lord by association. This caused much distress for the four
scorpion princes residing in the cave, who were often the subject of idle
gossip.

The second sister paid no mind to such rumors. Among the four sons of
the Scorpionlord, she favored only those who were the most helpful to
her.

A few days ago, she had acquired a celestial vine seed from somewhere and
planted it in her private courtyard within the cave, assigning the eldest
scorpion prince to guard it.

The eldest scorpion prince, delighted, assumed this meant the second
sister had feelings for him. One day, he approached the Hundred-Eyed
Daoist Master, asking for help in matchmaking. The master laughed and
shook his head, saying that a woman with such a strong will would only
look down on him more if he sought someone else's help in proposing. He
advised the prince to come up with a plan on his own.

After returning to the cave, the eldest scorpion prince circled the celestial
vine repeatedly, but he still hadn't figured out a way to win her heart.

![The Second Sister](/image-20240827233332048.png)

## The First Sister

> The path home is covered in green moss,
> Peach blossoms begin to bloom across.
> How tender and gentle, her caring affection,
> Among sisters, a loving connection.

The eldest sister of the Zhu family was gentle and serene, caring for her
younger sisters like a mother. She meticulously managed every aspect of
their daily lives. Even the straightforward second sister and the
independent fourth sister behaved obediently and showed a touch of
girlish charm in her presence. Each day, she oversaw the cave's catering,
everyone's clothing, and was the go-to for disputes, illnesses, joys, and
sorrows, keeping her busy from dawn till dusk.

There was always a steady stream of courier lesser yaoguais coming to her
with messages: "My lady, the second and fourth ladies are arguing." "My
lady, the fifth lady scolded a weaver, and now they need an extra hand.
Can someone be sent?" "My lady, the sixth lady injured herself while
practicing and asks for you to come and have a look."

One day, the lady of the house, her mother, called her to her side. As soon
as she stepped into the hut, the tranquil scene of her mother admiring the
flowers under a tree caught her eyes. Her mother waved her over, saying,
"The flowers in our abode are more beautiful than those in the upper
realm." Meanwhile, outside the hut, the lesser yaoguai in charge of
catering was waiting for her to decide the menu, and the steward
overseeing the cocoons was waiting to report matters...

The eldest sister asked, "Mother, is there something you wish to instruct
me on?"

Her mother gently took her hand and said, "I just want you to accompany
me in admiring these flowers." She smiled warmly, adding, "I worry they
will wear you out." The eldest sister looked at her mother and was
suddenly transported back to many years ago, when her mother had held
her hand in the same way as they admired the peach blossoms together.
The flowers were beautiful then, and so was her mother.

## Elder Amourworm

> In the celestial garden, rare seeds grow,
> By the Purifying Spring, with an immortal glow.
> Transformed in the lower realm, forms unique,
> Such path to Dao, refined and sleek.

In ancient times, someone cast two celestial eggs from Mount Kunlun into
a blessed land on Earth. However, the Will of the mortal realm was not as
abundant as that of the celestial realm. As a result, the celestial eggs failed
to fully nurture and lost many of their wondrous abilities, taking on vastly
different forms. One of these celestial eggs was used to redeem the guilty,
while the other was hidden away by someone with ulterior motives. From
this hidden egg, various creatures emerged, and it came to be known as
the Elder Amourworm.

Every few days, the Elder Amourworm would produce insect eggs that
resembled blood sacs. If these eggs were ingested by a living being, the
larvae would devour their internal organs. Depending on the innate
differences of the larvae, the host would undergo a transformation,
turning into one of many types of insects.

If the eggs of the Elder Amourworm were not ingested, they would
naturally hatch into an ordinary Amourworm. These ordinary
Amourworm would spin silk to create cocoons, which they used to trap
their prey. The cocoons contained potent toxins that caused the trapped
creatures to experience a sensation of flying in the wind, as if floating on
clouds, instead of feeling suffocated. However, prolonged exposure to
these toxins led to abnormal changes in their bodies over time. Some
practitioners attempted to use this method to temper their bodies and
enhance their powers. However, it was ultimately considered a deviant
practice that easily led to a loss of sanity.

Since the celestial egg entered the mortal world, many have fallen victim
to its poison. The Amourworm, despite its terrifying appearance, is not
adept at combat. Aside from spewing filth from its mouth, it possesses no
remarkable abilities. However, its continued existence and proliferation in
the world suggest that it must provide some unknown benefits to certain
in dividuals.

## Centipede Guai

> Twisted in form, it charges like a gale,
> With feet unfurled, it strikes a deadly trail.
> Beware its breath, the venomous embrace,
> In narrow bounds, seek a wider space.

In bygone days, a young man embarked on a journey to the Webbed
Hollow seeking vengeance. However, his quest took a dark turn when he
Was captured by yaoguais and thrown into the Bonevault. Falling into a
deep pit, he landed in a lair of large insects. Despite suffering a broken leg,
he managed to survive. As he looked around, all he could see were
skeletons and remains, filling him with despair.

In the midst of his despair, he felt a sharp pain in his leg. A massive
centipede, as long as a person, had bitten him and torn off a piece of his
flesh to devour. Filled with terror, the young man instinctively grabbed a
stone and viciously crushed the centipede until it burst apart. Only then
did he realize that the stone he used was a human skull, which he quickly
discarded.

To his surprise, he noticed that the pain in his injured leg had subsided.
Curious, he applied some of the centipede's pus to a scraped arm, and the
pain diminished, likely due to the numbing effect of the venom. This
revelation sparked an idea in his mind. He tore strong silk threads from the
cocoons surrounding the pit and found two leg bones to serve as support
for his broken leg.

Exhausted from the ordeal, he rested, but soon heard rustling sounds
around him. He searched for the source of the noise, but it abruptly
ceased. Suddenly, a giant white ball descended from above, bouncing
several times before unfurling into a massive centipede, hundreds of times
larger than the first one. Swiftly, the young man curled himself into a ball,
mimicking the centipede's movements to confuse the colossal creature.

At that moment, more objects fell into the pit—-empty skins and remains.
From them emerged a swarm of smaller centipedes, feasting on the
discarded scraps. They passed by the young man, mistaking him for one of
their own. Realizing this, he began to imitate their behavior, observing
their habits and assimilating into their society. After ten days, he finally
managed to escape the Webbed Hollow.

Basking in the daylight, he came to understand that dwelling on the past
would not allow him to live a fulfilling life. Returning to his hometown, he
sought to lead a peaceful existence. However, the weavers, aware of his
visit to Zhu's Estate, gathered at his doorstep, demanding that he retrieve
treasures from the estate. Forced to hide from them, he found no respite
from the turmoil that surrounded him.

## Buddha's Right Hand

> The hand that plucked lotus from waters pristine,
> Of the same species, yet not from the same egg, it seems.
> Who can discern right from left, in life's uncertain scheme?
> In this tangled web, truth and illusion gleam.

In the olden days, a Daoist brought a pair of enormous arms into the
Webbed Hollow. The lesser yaoguais had no idea where they came from,
but judging by their form, they must have belonged to a great master. The
Hundred- Eyed Daoist Master personally visited and placed two egg-like
objects within the arms, instructing the yaoguais to guard them diligently.

At first, the arms exuded a thick, foul-smelling fluid. After some time, the
fluid dried up, forming a thick blood membrane that encased the arms.

Years passed, and from a distance, one could see something writhing
within the blood membrane, as if something was growing inside, eager to
break free. Exactly ten years later, two insects emerged from the eggs.
Their bodies resembled bees, their tails like hands, and their venomous
spit could kill any bird or beast and wither any plant it touched.

The Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master rejoiced at the news and organized a
grand feast to celebrate. Amidst the banquet, he turned to the Violet
Spider and shared a tale. "You may not be aware, but I once attempted a
similar endeavor on Purple Cloud Mountain. Alas, the celestial eggs failed
to hatch as intended, and I faced severe reprimand from our master.
However, this time, I have come to realize that the celestial eggs bestowed
upon us were not meant for lofty destinies to ascend. Creating yaoguais,
on the other hand, is an ideal outcome."

One of the insects had a left hand for a tail, and the other had a right hand.
They loved to hang upside down from the cave ceiling, dangling their tails
to lure prey. When the prey approached, they would clap their hands
together, crushing the prey into a pulp before lowering their heads to
swallow it whole.

Later, the left-handed insect went into the mountains to practice, while
the right-handed one, unable to clap anymore, preferred to guard narrow
paths. There, it could take full advantage of the terrain to capture and
devour any intruders.

## Baw-Li-Guhh-Baw

> By rocks, a living spring does flow,
> Glistening clear, glitters with glow.
> In its charm, a froglord does dwell,
> Frogs' venom, both sweet and foul.

Continuing from the previous story, the Daoist was rescued from the cold
pond by monks who carried him into the mountains. He initially expected
them to take him to a temple for healing, but to his surprise, they threw
him into a dungeon.

In the dungeon, he endured beguiling chants, suffered from red eyes, and
narrowly escaped death multiple times. Despite the hardships, his martial
skills improved significantly, which he considered a fortunate turn of
events. When he finally returned to the original spot, the frog was
nowhere to be found. He left the New West and continued his journey.

One sunny day, the Daoist arrived at a ridge covered in lush greenery, with
a few thatched huts indicating habitation. Seeking a place to rest, he
stepped into a large courtyard but accidentally fell into a hole.
Inside, he found layers of spider webs and insect guais everywhere.
Fortunately, he was no longer as helpless as before and managed to
navigate deeper into the cave. The tadpoles he had been nurturing in his
gourd suddenly became lively.

He squeezed through a stone crevice and saw a large crimson-skinned
frog occupying a natural spring, with insect guais keeping their distance.
Drawing his sword, he attacked the frog. They fought fiercely in the water,
one emitting crackling electricity, the other thrashing its limbs
powerfully. As they reached a stalemate, the frog opened its mouth and
extended a left hand from within, striking the Daoist's face and sending
him aback. The frog then tilted its head back, and the Daoist, having
learned his lesson, dared not approach. The frog spewed poisonous water,
which spread and contaminated the entire pond.

The Daoist hadn't anticipated this ability and, lacking any antidote,
hurriedly retreated through the stone crevice. As he did, he heard a female
voice behind him, "Daoist, why aren't you practicing your swordsmanship
at the temple? Are you here to seek death?"

Poisoned and unable to respond, he collapsed into the muddy pond. In his
hazy state, he heard the woman call for help, "Quick, carry him back to the
temple. We can't let him die here; it would be hard to explain."

## Commander Beetle

> When faced with traps, one must pass the test,
> When fortune smiles, do know when to rest.
> If a man of great will must vent his zest,
> Trade deeds for fame and rank with the best.

A young man from the Village of Shaded Heights served at the county
yamen, running errands for the local government. The magistrate
despised him and hindered his advances at every turn. One day, the
magistrate learned of a yaoguai haunting the Village of Lanxi. He sent the
young man to investigate alone and hoped he'd never return. Aware of the
magistrate's ill intent, the young man accepted the task without
hesitation; he chose not to beg for his life in this. As he entered the
desolate, eerie village, he was overcome with regret. But as night fell and
without knowledge of the mountain paths, he had no choice but to stay.

He found a less dilapidated house with intact eaves, barred all doors and
windows, and lit a lamp to steel himself for a long night, planning to
depart at first light. Fear gripped him at midnight, so he practiced his
swordplay to calm his nerves. After a while, a deep voice arose from the
darkness above the rafters: "I am a yaoguai of this ridge. I meant to kill you,
but with your fine swordsmanship and the official blade, you must be a
yamen runner, yes?"

The young man was startled but needed to voice his woes. He shared his
ordeal with the yaoguai and drew sighs of empathy. The yaoguai said, "1,
too, was once an imperial guard, but a treacherous court official cursed
me into a beetle to scrape by in these hills. I long for death, but I still wish
to pass on my sword skills to someone worthy. Now, if you're willing to
learn my skills, I offer to teach you."

The young man dared not to refuse. As he agreed, a beetle, over three
meters tall, descended from the shadows. Its neck bore a thick carapace
like a general's helm. The beetle wielded twin blades with a steadfast and
forceful style that suited the young man's disposition. Overjoyed, the
young man practiced with the beetle by the fading lamplight till dawn. As
they parted ways, the beetle said kindly, "The world these days is full of
those lacking talent and virtue and ascending through flattery. Why
tangle with them and sully yourself? Aim higher-a man should carve his
own path." With a hearty laugh, the beetle left.

This encounter changed the young man. He resigned from his position at
the yamen and enlisted in the border armies. His superb swordsmanship
elevated him to the rank of general. Leading the troops against foreign
foes, he won victory after victory and became a famed commander.

## Daoist Mi

> In empty mountains, falling blossoms sound,
> A flute's soft notes reveal homes around.
> Wearing masks that obscures false and true,
> They borrow forms to seek cinnabars' hue.

Long ago, a young man ventured alone to Webbed Ridge seeking
vengeance. However, he was captured by yaoguais and endured many
hardships in their lair before narrowly escaping. Upon his return to the
Kingdom of Zhuzi, numerous weavers approached him, hoping he would
lead them to the Estate of Zhu on the ridge to find the legendary jade
shuttle.

The young man, overwhelmed, shut his doors to visitors, but his mother
couldn't understand his reluctance and pressured him to lead the weavers
to the ridge to slay the yaoguais and rescue his father. Yet, human nature
is unpredictable, and the weavers, each with their own agendas, failed to
unite in the face of danger. They quarreled incessantly and were

ultimately wiped out by a giant green spider in the Estate. The young man,
cowering in fear, was shocked to see the spider transform into the green-
clad maiden he had once encountered in the cave. Disillusioned with
humanity, he tearfully begged the fairy to let him stay on the ridge and
cultivate. The green-clad maiden scolded him harshly and expelled him
from the Estate.

The young man wandered to an abandoned village on the ridge. The
insect guais, having heard of his plight, took pity on him. A dragonfly guai
introduced him to her master, the Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master, at the
Temple of Yellow Flowers.

At the temple, all the Daoists wore stone masks. The Daoist Master told the
young man that to achieve the Dao, he must sever all worldly ties and don
a stone mask to cut off his mortal connections. The young man hesitated
and wandered around the temple. Unexpectedly, an elderly woman in red
arrived with a group of beautiful maidens, including the green-clad
maiden and the girl in yellow.

Later, the temple hosted a banquet for the maidens. The young man,
spying from the side, saw the table laden with dishes: human oil stir-fried,
fresh human meat cooked and roasted, tofu blocks made from human
brains, and meat buns filled with human flesh. The stench was nauseating,
and he could only watch as the yaoguais feasted on humans. The Daoist
Master, noticing his shock, remarked indifferently, "It is in a yaoguai's
nature to eat humans. Mortal lives are short; even if we consume them, it
only shortens their lifespan by a few decades, a mere blink of an eye."

That night, the young man felt an overwhelming sense of loneliness.
Under the moonlight, he played a tune from his homeland, feeling utterly
lost. He realized that if he didn't become a yaoguai, he might be eaten by
his fellow disciples. Reflecting deeply, he questioned how he had ended
up in such a predicament. After a long night of tears, he resolved to
become a disciple and pursue the Dao. Since he couldn't change his fate,
he decided go with it. Determined, he asked his master for the quickest
path to becoming a yaoguai. The master told him, "In the Purple Cloud
Mountain, there is a rare insect called the Amourworm. Consuming its
eggs will allow you to ascend and become a yaoguai..."

## Five Element Carts

> Five carts align with elements five,
> From their fusion, fiery life does thrive.
> Beast heads roar as they swiftly race,
> Fire wheels east and west, the path they trace.

At Flaming Mountains, Red Boy was about to celebrate his hundredth
birthday. He was in high spirits and asked the Keeper, "My birthday is
coming soon. Can I go out and play for a while?"

The Keeper replied, "As your father instructed when he ordered me to
watch over you, I must ensure you focus on your practice. You cannot go
out at will."

Red Boy argued, "1 have already mastered the Samadhi Fire. Can't I take a
break for a few days?" As he spoke, he punched his nose, releasing a burst
of flames.

The Keeper shook his head, "You were taught the Samadhi Fire so that you
could use it to refine your inner core. Spitting fire carelessly such as that
dissipates your qi and is nothing more than a trivial trick."

He continued, "The liver corresponds to wood, which generates fire; the
heart corresponds to fire, which generates earth; the spleen corresponds
to earth, which generates metal; the lungs correspond to metal, which
generates water; the kidneys correspond to water, which generates wood.
The five elements generate each other in a continuous cycle. With the
Samadhi Fire, you should use it to refine the energy of your five organs."

Growing impatient, Red Boy said, "Enough, I understand. 1'll go back to
my practice."

On his birthday, the Bull King hosted a grand banquet in the mountains,
inviting many friends to celebrate. Red Boy ordered some minions to bring
out five small carts. The minions arranged the carts according to the five
elements: gold, wood, water, fire, and earth. Red Boy approached them,
recited an incantation, and spat out fire from his mouth while thick smoke
erupted from his nose. Flames burst forth from his eyes, and fire surged
from the five carts. After several bursts, the red flames blazed into the sky.

The Keeper was displeased, feeling that Red Boy was too playful and
overly interested in trivial tricks. He feared that the boy might waste his
potential in the days to come.

However, the Bull King was very pleased. To him, although Red Boy was
not engaged in deep practice, he already understood how to employ his
skills to create useful tools, which showed great ingenuity. He
immediately ordered the creation of five larger war carts for his son.

From then on, the Five Element Carts became Red Boy's companions in his
practice. Within a hundred years, these carts, imbued with his Samadhi
Fire, gained sentience and became formidable guais in the Flaming
Mountains.

## Father of Stones

> In mountains, a deity grand,
> Envy not, but anger does stand.
> Within his grasp, a skeleton light,
> A romance lost in the distant land.

One day, a tattered-clothed girl stumbled into the valley of Yellow Wind
Ridge. Covered in wounds, she sought refuge in a cave belonging to a rock
guai after noticing some living goods inside.

When the Father of Stones discovered her presence, his initial intention
was to expel her. However, upon witnessing her pitiable condition, he
relented and granted her permission to rest for a while. To his surprise,
the girl ingeniously utilized the wild fruits and game found in the cave to
prepare a delectable meal. The tantalizing aroma tempted the Father of
Stones, leading him to reconsider his decision and allow her to stay and
continue cooking. From that point forward, the stone deity would
regularly procure ingredients, while the girl skillfully transformed them

into delicious dishes. Thus, the guai and the girl coexisted harmoniously
for a span of two years.

During a routine day of washing clothes by the river, the girl unexpectedly
encountered a woodcutter from her village. Overwhelmed with emotions
upon seeing a familiar face, she couldn't contain her tears upon returning
to the cave. Through her sobs, she revealed the harrowing truth that she
had fled from her abusive parents, who planned to force her into a
marriage with a foolish suitor in exchange for a dowry. The girl now lived
in constant fear of being captured and forcibly taken back to her
oppressive home.

As expected, the following day at noon, a group of villagers arrived at the
valley. The girl's parents, afraid of the yaoguai, desperately pleaded at the
entrance of the cave. Despite their pleas, the determined girl refused to
comply with their demands. Frustrated and enraged, her parents resorted
to cursing her. However, their vitriol subsided momentarily when the
Father of Stones emerged from the cave and bellowed a commanding
shout, causing the villagers to retreat in fear. Yet, as soon as the stone
deity returned inside, the villagers resumed their insults, persistently
tormenting the girl.

The Father of Stones decided to guard the entrance, but the girl's parents
threatened to bring a Daoist to subdue the stone guais if their daughter
was not returned.

Fearing that her presence would bring further trouble to the stone guais,
the girl made the difficult decision to quietly leave the cave during the
night. Tragically, she fell off a cliff and lost her life. The following day, the
stone guais discovered her lifeless body, already cold and devoid of any
signs of life.

Upon hearing about Lady Rakshasi of Flaming Mountains and her reputed
power and compassionate nature, the stone deity made a difficult journey,
carrying the girl's lifeless body to seek her help.

However, Lady Rakshasi, with her deep understanding of life and death,
examined the girl's body and came to a somber conclusion. She expressed
that attempting to revive her would be futile. Even if she were forcibly
brought back to life, she would be nothing more than a soulless shell,
devoid of the essence that made her who she was.

Unwilling to give up, the stone deity waited on the mountain path of
Flaming Mountains every day with the girl's body, hoping to gain
Rakshasi's sympathy. Even as the girl's flesh turned to bones, he did not
abandon his hope.

## Quick as Fire, Fast as Wind

> Fiery spirit, life he stakes, Madness flaunts the wind he makes.
> Nostrils flare with smoky breath, Mouth exclaims with flames of death.
> Smoke ascends, the wind does chase, Fire spreads with wind's embrace.
> Loyalty worth a thousand gold, Together strong, their bond unfolds.

In bygone days, there were two ruffians wandering the city, always
spending their nights beneath the same section of the city wall, thus
forming a close bond.

With no attachments or concerns, they acted recklessly and without
restraint. One time, during their robbery of a wealthy young master, they
accidentally killed him, leading to their joint sentencing to death by
beheading, their execution scheduled in the autumn.

While imprisoned, one ruffian said to the other, "We've had a carefree
life, and if we must die, so be it. It's a pity we won't be able to enjoy
ourselves together anymore.".

The other ruffian replied, "If you wish to continue our fun together, it's
not impossible. I am a descendant of the 'Falling Head Clan' and possess
some tricks." He then whispered a set of skills into his companion's ear.

Come autumn, the two were beheaded in the public square. As the
executioner sprayed wine and swung his blade, their heads fell to the
ground but suddenly flew up into the air, much to the astonishment and
cheers of the onlookers.

Afterwards, the two heads flew into the mountains and became yaoguais,
one named "Quick as Fire" and the other "Fast as Wind".

![Quick as Fire, Fast as Wind](/image-20240827233657412.png)

## Cloudy Mist, Misty Cloud

> Let the strange be strange, the odd be odd,
> Follow the boy master, let mountains fall in chaos.
> Flaunt neither strength nor take pride,
> When disputes come near, cast them aside.

Once upon a time, there were three ghosts who shared a single body. They
aspired to earn the title of mountain deity and thus, with their bribe paid,
they targeted at a blind mountain deity of Mount Hao to take his place.

Although the mountain god was blind, his hearing was exceptionally
sharp. He was highly skilled in the art of smoke and fire, able to release
smoke to conceal his movements. Whenever the three ghosts came to
provoke him, he would immediately vanish into hiding.

One time, the three ghosts combined their powers to emit a sweeping
flash of lightning, forcing the mountain deity out of hiding. The mountain
deity cried out, waving his incense sticks wildly. The three ghosts, being
clumsy, couldn't dodge and got hit. Seeing their clothes catch fire, the
three ghosts forgot about the mountain deity and started blaming each
other.

As they quarreled, a burst of laughter echoed from the cliff. A young boy
with red skin and white hair sat there, watching them as if enjoying a
show.

Embarrassed and angry, the three ghosts and the mountain deity
temporarily set aside their differences and attacked the young boy. The
boy, finding it amusing, wielded a sharp spear and sparred with them.

Unexpectedly, the mountain deity's smoke perfectly concealed the clumsy
bodies of the three ghosts, while the ghosts' lightning provided
opportunities for the mountain deity to attack. Together, they managed to
fight the young boy for several rounds. It wasn't until the boy used his
Samadhi True Fire that they fell to the ground, begging for mercy.

Then, Red Boy told them,"From now on, these six hundred miles of
mountains are mine. You will follow me and become my captains."

From then on, the three ghosts were given a new name, "Cloudy Mist",
and the blind mountain deity was named "Misty Cloud". They continued
to serve Red Boy as a team, but their deep-seated animosity remained
unresolved, leading to frequent quarrels that persisted to this day.

## Top Takes Bottom, Bottom Takes Top

> A beauty weds a beast so vile,
> With horns and fangs, a facade's sweet guile.
> In love's embrace, they form a pair,
> Rolling in the haze, many lives they ensnare.

This story was told by Minster Xu.

Years ago, Xu, dissatisfied with his wife's strict adherence to propriety and
her lack of warmth in the chamber, took a fiery and beautiful concubine.

This concubine had a terrible temper, often bossing Xu around and
showing no respect for the lady of the house. If anyone tried to talk her
into adhering to manners and propriety, she would laugh and curse them
until they left in disgrace. Yet, Xu found this amusing and indulged her in
every way, spoiling her with affection.

One day, Xu was returning to the capital to report on his duties. Fearing
that their carriage might be attacked by bandits, he hired a large boat to
transport his family, servants, and belongings back to the capital. That
night, the sound of fighting suddenly erupted on the boat. It turned out
that a yaoguai had sneaked aboard under the cover of darkness. Soon, a
terrifying figure with horns and jagged teeth appeared. He wore a tattered
cloth around his waist, held a pot-shaped shield in his left hand, and
wielded an iron whip in his right, glaring menacingly at everyone.

Xu and his wife trembled in fear, but the concubine stood tall and
unafraid, loudly scolding the yaoguai for his rudeness. The yaoguai was
taken aback for a moment, then sighed and said, "Even in human form,
you are so arrogant. Truly, you are one of us, a Yaksha."

The concubine burst into laughter and said, "Nonsense! I intended to play
for a while longer, but now you've ruined everything. Fine, let's kill them
all and leave together." With that, she transformed into a creature
identical to the yaoguai.

Xu finally realized that he had brought a yaoguai into his home.

Just as the two yaoguais were about to kill Xu and his family, a female voice
rang out, "Even though the your kingdom has fallen and you were forced
to seek shelter in the east, you should not behave so rudely. Why not
follow me into the mountains for your practice?" Just when the two
yaoguais were ready to resist, a woman descended onto the bow of the
boat, holding a precious fan. With a powerful wave of the fan, she
immobilized them in the wind.

After this terrifying experience, Xu never dared to take another concubine.

![Top Takes Bottom, Bottom Takes Top](/image-20240827233738257.png)

## Flint Chief

> Divine fire crafts a wondrous device,
> In the depths of the flame pool, it hides from eyes.
> Foes arise with swift, fierce might,
> In the clash, its grandeur shines bright.

When it comes to who spoiled Red Boy the most in Flaming Mountains, it
has to be the Keeper. However, Red Boy didn't always appreciate it, much
like his parents, the Bull King and Lady Rakshasi, who took the Keeper's
efforts for granted. After all, he was not one of the family, and regardless
of how much effort he put in, to others, he was still an outsider.

One day, Red Boy demanded to have a Flint Vanguard, modeled after the
Stone Vanguard of Yellow Wind Ridge. The Bull King and Lady Rakshasi
did not favor the plan, but the Keeper immediately agreed. Fearing that
just a Stone Vanguard wouldn't be enough to entertain Red Boy, he went
ahead and created more rock guais. Among them was a giant rock guai
with arms and legs strong enough to support its massive body.

This giant rock guai was more formidable than the others, usually lying
dormant in the river of fire. It would only emerge when summoned by its
master or when a powerful enemy intruded. Red Boy didn't like these rock
guais that the Keeper had created without his permission and mostly
visited only the Flint Vanguard.

Since Red Boy lived with Lady Rakshasi in the Emerald Hall, the Keeper
stationed these rock guais in Furnace Valley. Later, when Red Boy
besieged Flaming Mountains, these rock guais from the river of fire proved
to be quite helpful, inevitably leading to some speculation over the Keeper
himself.

![Flint Chief](/image-20240827233759319.png)

## Flint Vanguard

> Odd rocks with fiery streaks, from a fiery river they rise,
> Forged in the blazing inferno, under the scorching skies.
> With loyalty, they shape rivers and move mountains high,
> Unmoved by the world's chaos, they stand firm and nigh.

Bodhisattva Guanyin was set to visit New Mount Sumeru to discuss
important Buddhist matters with Bodhisattva Lingji. As Red Boy was
always eager to serve Guanyin, he accompanied her on the journey.

Upon arriving at New Mount Sumeru, they learned that Bodhisattva Lingji
was still away on a trip to Yellow Wind Ridge. Thus, Guanyin turned
towards Yellow Wind Ridge. Given the urgency of the matter, she
instructed Red Boy to wait for her by the river valley.

As Red Boy wandered alone by the river, he noticed a massive rock guai
standing majestically by the water's edge like a giant guard hound. The
rock guai diligently moved stones and piled dirt into foothills. Intrigued,
committed the sight to memory.

Several years later, due to the Bull King's return to Flaming Mountains,
Guanyin suddenly summoned Red Boy and instructed him to fulfill his
duties to his family, allowing him to return to his homeland.

As time passed, travelers passing by the base of Flaming Mountains saw a
large flint rock guai, as big as a house, standing prominently by the fiery
river. It tirelessly moved stones and dirt, its diligent demeanor resembling
that of a giant guard hound, leaving people in awe and wonder.

## Mother of Flamlings

> Springs birth rivers, trees root in the ground,
> Gold's elusive source is seldom found.
> Wealth like clouds, can vanish in a day,
> Yet honor stands like mountains, will always stay

There once was a medicine gatherer named Cheng Ming, who gained fame
for selling Flame Ores. One day, a burly man dressed as an immortalist
visited Chengming's herb shop. The immortalist produced a palm-sized
piece of cinnabar in the color of gold.

Intrigued, Cheng Ming inquired, "What is this?" The immortalist replied,
"This is Gold Flame Ore, a treasure from inside the Mother of Flamlings.
I've heard of your fame as a medicine gatherer, and I can offer a
partnership.."

Cheng Ming asked, "What is this Mother of Flamlings?" and the
immortalist answered, "It is ten times larger than a typical Flamling, and
could fetch a fortune in gold." The catch is the need for a substantial
amount of Flame Ores as bait.

Initially, Cheng Ming declined because it cost him his precious Flame
Ores, but the immortalist returned with a load of the ores, and beseeched
him, "I have an urgent need for Gold Flame Ore. Find the Mother of
Flamlings with these baits I've given you, and if you catch it, you shall
receive the gold I promised."

Cheng Ming accepted such a lucrative offer in an instant, and the two set
off on the following day.

During their journey, the immortalist realized Cheng Ming lacked any
power and used mere street tricks to deceive the Flame guais. However, as
a true man who did not fuss over minor quibbles, he accepted Cheng
Ming's methods, and together, they located the Flamlings' lair.

There, the immortalist lured out the enormous Mother of Flamlings using
copious amounts of Flame Ores. Confronted by the Mother, they were
bombarded with fireballs and overwhelmed. Cheng Ming had no power to
resist and was nearly burned to death. Yet, faced with no escape, in a
desperate act to save Cheng Ming from the woe he led him into, the
immortalist mounted his sword and flew directly at the Mother. He slew
her at the price of his own life.

As the Mother of Flamlings lay dead, all the Flamlings fell lifeless. Cheng
Ming harvested the Gold Flame Ore from the Mother, and the Flame Ores
from the Flamlings, alongside the bait brought by the immortalist. He
returned with a fortune and wrote books like "Mountain Chronicles" and
"Observations of Fire", boasting of his solo conquest of the Mother of
Flamlings.

If you wonder why Cheng Ming turned to writing instead of continuing
his life gathering Flame Ores, a line in his book hints at the answer: "With
the Mother's demise, her children scattered, and no Flamlings will appear
here for five hundred years."

![Mother of Flamlings](/image-20240827233837471.png)

## Baw-Lang-lang

> Radiant hues of crimson bright,
> Majestic with its towering might.
> Seeking a place of cool repose,
> Releasing fire, a neat trick shows.

Here we must speak once more of the frog-seeking Daoist. Being carried
back to the Temple of Yellow Flowers, the Daoist was treated for his
injuries. Without asking him a word, everyone assumed he had come to
join them, as a disciple, so they took extra care of him.

While at the temple, the Daoist observed the others practicing. Through
self-studying, he managed to learn a few techniques, such as "Meteor-
smash" and "Stallion-spring". Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master, hearing the
Daoist's tales of his travels, recognized his quick wit and boldness and
decided to take him as a disciple. Overwhelmed by the honor, the Daoist
immediately knelt and acknowledged his master. That night, however, he
quietly packed his belongings and left the temple, resuming his quest to
find the world's rarest frogs.

The next day, when the Master was informed of his departure, he laughed
and said, "He has small ambitions and is unrestrained by conventions. One
of a kind indeed."

The Daoist continued his journey and arrived at the Flaming Mountains.
At the foot of Cooling Slope, he encountered a large, fiery-red frog. They
were about to engage in battle when a purple-skinned lion-dog emerged
from a cave behind the slope.

This purple-skinned beast was extremely aggressive. Seeing the two of
them lingering near its cave, it charged straight at them. The Daoist was
initially intimidated by its presence, but the large frog kicked the beast
away, saving his life.

Angered by the frog's interference, the purple-skinned beast turned to
attack it. The frog opened its mouth, and with a gulp, spewed a stream of
fire, forcing the beast to retreat several steps.

Seizing the chance, the Daoist used all the techniques he had recently
learned, "Meteor-smash" and "Stallion-spring", against the beast. Seeing
them join forces, the beast fled back into the cave.

The Daoist pursued it into the cave, only to find the interior remarkably
cool, a stark contrast to the scorching heat of Flaming Mountains.
Before long, the frog also hopped into the cave and hid in a shady corner.
The Daoist realized that although the frog could breathe fire, its nature
made it fear the mountain's heat, and the cave was the cool place it sought
to rest.

Even this yaoguai had a desire to live. With this surprising understanding,
the Daoist felt a surge of compassion and abandoned any thoughts of
killing it. He sheathed his sword and left the cave.

![Baw-Lang-lang](/image-20240827233854885.png)

## Son of Stones

> A young stone dwelling by mountainside,
> From deep within, where wonders hide.
> With hidden gifts that brightly gleam,
> Pure nature's charm within its dreams.

According to celestial laws, mountain deities are forbidden from leaving
their designated mountains without just cause. Should they be found
wandering without reason, they would be dismissed and subjected to
interrogation.

Before the Son of Stones had come of age and was unable to assume the
role of mountain deity, the Mother of Stones was bound to remain at
Yellow Wind Ridge. She had no choice but to send him alone to search for
his father. Fearing for her son's safety on his journey, the Mother of Stones
transferred a considerable portion of her Stone Essence to him before
allowing him to depart.

Unfortunately, as soon as the Son of Stones set out, he went in the
opposite direction of his father. His father headed west, while he went
east, eventually arriving at Mount Huaguo.

At first, he diligently searched every mountain he came upon for signs of
his father. Should he find none, he would proceed to the next. Yet, the
charm and fascination of Mount Huaguo enticed him to stay.

If queried about his greatest delight, it would certainly be the cricket
known as Feng-Tail General. Daily, he would sit upon the mountain,
watching the cricket's soaring leapsing landings, applauding
with great pleasure. Gradually, he forgot entirely about his quest to find
his father.

## Poison Chief

> Together we roam the world's far end,
> In shared hardships, our spirits blend.
> With harmony, our bond grows tight,
> Though rootless, we thrive in the light.

From the peak of Mount Huaguo, struck by a celestial axe, many rocks and
trees tumbled down. Among them was a cliff rock that had absorbed the
essence of the universe for countless years. The axe's blow liberated it
from its burdens, granting it the potential to turn into something sentient.

Alongside this rock fell a crooked tree, severed in half with broken roots
and branches, appearing on the brink of death.

The tree implored the cliff rock, "We once occupied the same place. Now,
I am nearing death. Please, help me." The rock, perplexed, responded, "1
am but a mere rock. How could I offer you aid?" The tree explained, "You
possess spiritual potential. If you would allow me to anchor my roots in
your body for a few days, I might yet survive."

The rock, mindful of its reputation, reluctantly consented. The tree
entwined its ancient roots around the rock, securing itself firmly. When
the rock expressed discomfort, the tree replied, "I am heavy and must bind
tightly to prevent my fall."

Months passed, and the tree's vines and roots had deeply embedded
themselves into various parts of the rock. The rock, enduring great pain,
attempted to dislodge the tree with all its strength, but it felt as though it
was being torn apart. The roots had merged with the rock, making
separation impossible. Consumed by anger, the rock cursed the tree daily,
and both harbored mutual resentment.

Eventually, the crooked tree, now infused with the rock's spiritual
essence, began to emit toxins and prey upon living creatures. This
newfound power brought a strange harmony between them. Alas, how
unexpected it is to witness a relationship once fraught with conflict
transform into one of mutual benefit.

## Water-Wood Beast

> Fortune or misfortune, hard to foresee,
> Blaming heaven and earth, yet still bound to be.
> Better to find joy in simple ways,
> Ride the waves, and await brighter days.

Long ago, there stood a camphor tree that had grown for a thousand
years, its branches lush and verdant. One day, a natural disaster uprooted
it, casting it into a river.

Due to its immense size and weight, the narrow river could not bear the
camphor tree, leaving it stranded. A few days later, the villagers planned to
drag it away for lumber. Unexpectedly, the camphor tree began to stir,
transforming into a colossal four-legged wooden beast that lurked in the
water.

From that time on, any craftsman with ill intentions who approached
would be hurled into the water by the beast, striking fear into their hearts.
However, when children came to play in the river, it never frightened
them. Instead, it would occasionally use its wooden branches to rescue
those in danger of drowning. Over time, the villagers grew accustomed to
its presence and named it the "Water-Wood Beast."

One year, a wandering Daoist passed through the area and heard about the
Water- Wood Beast. He called out from the riverbank, "Are you not weary
of being confined here? There are many of your kind elsewhere. You
should consider leaving."

The Water-Wood Beast remained unmoved, and two more years passed.
Then, during a season of relentless heavy rain, the river's water level rose
ever higher. The Water-Wood Beast repeatedly battered against the
riverbank, causing the villagers to flee to a neighboring village in fear. That
night, the upstream riverbank gave way, flooding the downstream village.
When the floodwaters finally receded, the villagers returned to find that
the Water- Wood Beast had vanished from the riverbend.

## Jiao-Loong of Waves

> Green claws like steel, a crimson maw,
> Breath turns rain and wind with awe.
> Leaping waves, white crests arise,
> In the tides, life's fate lies.

Ancient texts record that the jiao is a divine creature of the waters, capable
of commanding fish to fly. When in water, it retains its divine nature;
when out of water, it loses its divinity.

In Village of Chen, there was a fisherman who, upon hearing Sun
Wukong's tale of dismantling the Linggan Temple, learned of a jiao that
could command the fish in the river. Inspired, the fisherman wished to
acquire the jiao's skills, hoping to make the fish leap into his nets, thus
saving everyone much labor.

One day, while out fishing, dark clouds gathered in the sky. Soon a fierce
storm erupted, unleashing torrential rain and violent waves. His fishing
boat was overturned by the waves, disappearing without a trace in the
blink of an eye.

By a stroke of fate, as he sank to the riverbed, he encountered the jiao deity
patrolling the river and was saved. The fisherman pleaded earnestly for
the deity to teach him some skills. Moved by his compassion, the jiao deity
taught him some practices of water beings.

Several days passed without the fisherman's return; everyone assumed he
had drowned in the storm. They prepared a simple coffin and planned to
erect a cenotaph in his memory.

On the day of the funeral, a downpour ensued, and a large jiao emerged
from the river. It swept its long tail, bringing many fish ashore. The
villagers rushed to the riverbank and saw the jiao transform into the
fisherman, walking out of the river. They were both astonished and
overjoyed.

However, after returning home, the fisherman soon felt his spirit weary
and only regained his vitality when he returned to the water. It was then
that everyone realized he could no longer live on land.

Indeed, a few days later, the fisherman leaped into the waves and
disappeared into the water, never to be seen again.

## Lang-Baw-Baw

> In fairy mountains, fate decides my stay,
> By nature's flow, I turn to stone each day.
> Seeking truth with purpose, unaware of the length,
> With steadfast heart, I carve my path, my strength.

Long ago, there was a Daoist who dedicated his life to capturing yaoguais.
During one encounter with a frog guai, he traveled far and wide, seeking
their traces. Along the way, he gained many opportunities and became a
highly skilled Daoist. He also came to understand that all beings had their
own ways of survival and were no longer obsessed over capturing
yaoguais. Instead, he grew curious about their lives.

One day, as he passed by Mount Huaguo, he was captivated by the
beautiful scenery and decided to release the tadpole that had
accompanied him on his journey back into the mountain stream.
Unexpectedly, as soon as he let the little frog guai go, several bolts of
lightning struck down, revealing a group of armored celestial soldiers.
The Daoist thought he had caused some trouble and was about to
apologize when the celestial soldiers attacked him without a word. He
quickly drew his sword to defend himself but was gradually overwhelmed
by their numbers. Just as he was about to be seriously injured, a large stone
frog leaped from the riverbank. Unafraid of the flashing blades, and even
the lightning summoned by the soldiers, the stone frog helped the Daoist
fend off his opponents.

The Daoist approached the riverbank and realized that the little frog guai
he had released had brought the stone frog to rescue him. He was deeply
grateful. From that day on, the Daoist no longer aspired to become
immortal. Instead, he frequently visited the frog guais, asking them for
tadpoles to release into various beautiful mountains and rivers. People
began to call him the Frog Immortal.

## Gold Armored Rhino

> With thunderous horns and armor of gold so bright,
> One can charge forth, the ground quaking with might.
> A form of strength, no evil dares draw near,
> An unyielding heart, forever held dear.

It was well known that Sun Wukong, after being tempered in Lord Lao's
Furnace, acquired a heart of gold, lungs of silver, a head of copper, and an
iron body. Yet, what many might not realize is that even his seemingly
invulnerable body still could feel pain when injured.

He was pinned beneath the mountain for five hundred years, with no visits
from his underlings, sustained only by the mountain deities and keepers
who provided him with iron pellets and molten copper. He suffered
injuries from the Samadhi Wind at Yellow Wind Ridge, was trapped in the
transforming gourd of the Gold and Silver Horn brothers at Flat Top
Mountain, scorched unconscious by the Samadhi Fire at Withered Pine
Stream, beheaded in the Kingdom of Chechi, stung on the head by the
Scorpion Guai in Pipa Cave, imprisoned within the golden cymbal in the
New West, captured in the golden light trap at the Temple of Yellow
Flowers, had his heart gouged out in the Kingdom of Bhikku, and endured
the tightening headband curse numerous times, each instance squeezing
his head until it almost resembled a gourd.

Through bodily harm and mental torment, only he could guide the rest of
the journeyers to the foot of Mount Lingshan. If the Golden Armored
Rhino was truly transformed from the Great Sage's golden armor as they
say, it indeed mirrored the Great Sage's indomitable spirit, never yielding
to defeat. Even if its horn was shattered, it never lost the resolve to charge
into battle, standing resolute and ready to fight anew.

## Cloudtreading Deer

> The wind uplifts the noble high,
> While low clouds mark the flesh to die.
> Halt steps in azure skies,
> Or roam where earth's filth lies.

When Sun Wukong was learning the arts at Mount Lingtai, Patriarch
Bodhi not only taught him the seventy-two transformations but also
imparted the "Somersault Cloud" technique. From then on, Wukong's
body became invulnerable, and his movements agile. However, when he
showed off his skills in front of others, the Patriarch foresaw that his lack
of patience would lead to trouble.

Immortals often say that Sun Wukong was at his most mischievous and
ruthless when he was the Monkey King. Yet, during that time, aside from
his battles with the Celestial Court, he rarely harmed other beings. It was
only after he became a disciple, following his master and gaining
direction, that he developed many thunderous methods. Stealing,
robbing, kidnapping, killing, arson, and destroying mountains and caves-
all became second nature to him.

This Cloudtreading Deer is said to be transformed from Sun Wukong's
Lotus Silk Cloudtreaders. It reflects his free-spirited and agile nature but
also harbors his inherent ferocity. Once he falls behind, his true nature is
revealed, and he can no longer maintain his carefree facade.

## Feng-Tail General

> Fiery tails upon its forehead,
> Preying by the mountainside.
> The skilled one shuns the wars it dreads,
> The unskilled roars with reckless pride.

The Sage Stone Monkey, with his inherent wisdom, learned the ways of
human manners and speech during his travels across various realms and
later achieved mastery of the Dao at Mount Lingtai. Setting aside his
natural endowments, let us now examine his later pursuits in
enlightenment.

When he left in a huff at Yingchou Stream, the Old Loong King reasoned
with him, and he returned to admit his mistakes. He abandoned arbitrary
actions and always heeded sound advice.

He forged brotherly bonds with yaoguais, engaged in jest with immortals,
and exchanged banter with Bodhisattvas. His amiable nature endeared
him to all, who were ever willing to offer their assistance. He had a sense
of decorum and propriety.

He had the ability to summon wind and rain and could seek out loongs. He
could transform into guais for scouting or borrow vessels when needed.
In times of trouble, he sought the aid of higher beings, seldom relying on
brute force.

This Feng-Tail General, with multiple eyes on his head, had a keen
understanding of both himself and his enemies. He was adept at leaping
and dodging, avoiding powerful foes whenever possible, and displayed a
touch of the monkey's cleverness. It's no wonder that the crown on the
monkey's head grasped his nimble thoughts so well.

## Emerald-Armed Mantis

With ruby eyes and jade adorned,
Wielding its blades, fierce and scorned.
When justice falters to show,
An iron fist will strike the blow.

Tang Monk often advocated for kindness, while Sun Kong was known for
his punishment of evil.

At Kui-Mu Wolf's abode, upon learning of the princess's suffering and her
reluctance to leave due to her feelings for the yaoguai and children bore
for him, Sun Wukong ordered Bajie to throw the yaoguai's children from
the height, reducing them to two lumps of flesh.

At Old Yang's house, after learning of the unfilial deeds of the old couple's
son and seeing how they indulged him for the sake of incense offerings, he
proceeded to behead the son despite Old Yang's pleas.

Sun Wukong's nature was to show no mercy to villains and evildoers; he
delighted in eradicating evils and yaoguais. The numerous blood debts on
the journey to the West, though each had its reasons, were mostly
attributed to the monkey.

The world knew of the other three pieces of armor, but they were
unaware that the mantis was actually transformed from the Great Sage's
gauntlet. It seems the gauntlet inherited the Great Sage's ruthlessness, for
it played tricks on Zhu Bajie with the same cunning.

## Lingxuzi

> His grey fur speaks of fierce might,
> With blood-stained fangs that gleam in the night.
> Claws like soul-reapers, tail swings death's song,
> Feigns Buddhist ways, but his bloodlust stays strong.

The grey wolf guai of the temple was once an exile from the Kingdom of
Shituo. When Shituo was laid to ruin, the wolves fed, following the grey
wolf on a long and weary road, until they found shelter under the banner
of the Black Wind King.

Unlike the old Lingxuzi, who pursued immortality and detachment, the
grey wolf cared nothing for the ways of deities and Buddha, nor for the
empty promises of eternal life. Instead, his heart was set on mastering
strength and skill. He honed his craft with iron claws and fangs until he
could strip the very flesh from the bones of his foes.

When the old Lingxuzi vanished, Black Bear Guai saw fit to elevate the
When the old Lingxuzi vanished, Black Bear Guai saw fit to elevate the
grey wolf to be the new master of the wolf guais, giving him the name
Lingxuzi and tasking him with guarding the Guanyin Temple.
The wolf guais who came with the new Lingxuzi from the Kingdom of
Shituo also rose in power and surpassed those who had served longer in
the distribution of spoils and favors. The local wolf guais had little
affection for the ways of the new Lingxuzi, and after finding themselves
thrust aside, bitterness took root in their hearts. In their shared sense of
grievance, they found a new unity of purpose. Often they gathered in
secret, comforting each other, sharing the old memories when the old
master was in power, and quietly plotting against the new one.
But Lingxuzi was prepared. Under the pretense of a roll call, he gathered
the local wolf guais in the temple and gave the signal to his loyal guards to
seize the malcontents. The temple erupted into chaos. Lingxuzi then
leaped down from the roof into the crowd, ready to devour all who dared
to betray him.

The Fireblade Wolf, hearing the commotion, rushed over and managed to
hold Lingxuzi off and bought the minions time to flee to safety. When
Black Wind King learned of this, he was ready to unleash punishment
upon the rebellious wolf guais, but the snake guai mediated, and peace
was restored. Yet from that day forth, the local wolf guais refused to tread
even within the shadow of the walls of Guanyin Temple.

![Lingxuzi](/image-20240828215359942.png)

## The Red Loong

> Smoke rises high, from wood afire.
> Hit the back, let the beats respire, as in mist, thunders conspire.

After the case of the Old Loong King of Jing River was settled, the loong
princes found themselves facing an uncertain future. Following the
journey west, rewards were given based on merit, but only the loong
princes alone awaited judgment, heightening their anxiety. They sought
out Yuan Shoucheng and asked him for a sign of their fortunes. The signs
showed "The loong lies hid; not a time for action," which became a thorn
in their hearts. Among them, the most concerned were the Four Loongs
who governed the four rivers and knew well the might of those above.
They took the initiative to resign, hoping to save their lives by retreating.
Yet, the letters they submitted to the Celestial Court were all returned.
Time flew by, and one day, Yuan Shoucheng sought out the Four Loongs.
He relayed that the signs had shifted to "The loong lies hid; it stirs in the
deep", indicating a favorable time for action. Upon hearing this, the Four
Loongs left their underwater abode and went their separate ways to plan
their next moves.

The Red Loong was quite astute. Knowing that Black Bear Guai was greedy
for treasures and had the protection of Guanyin, he bartered all his
valuable possessions with Black Bear Guai in exchange for an ideal cave
nestled in the mountains. Afterward, he went into seclusion in the cave
and slept for many years.

One day, he awoke and wanted to soar up the sky and stretch his body
again, but he found that he could hardly climb the clouds. He
remembered an ancient saying: "When a loong wishes to ascend to the
sky, it must first climb the claw-wood." He wielded his thunderbolt tail to
carve out a set of claw-wood in the mountains to help him fly, but it was
still to no avail.
The Red Loong was unwilling to accept defeat and sought help from Black
Bear Guai. Although Black Bear Guai was not good at flying, he couldn't
resist the chance for profit that presented itself. He sold the Boshan
Censer he had brought from Guanyin's place to the Red Loong, claiming
that the censer could create clouds and smoke. He cited a passage from
ancient texts to persuade the Red Loong: "Aloong cannot traverse
without clouds."

The Red Loong believed this to be true. He embedded the censer on his
back and burned his Will to forcibly create smoke from it. When one
censer was not enough, he added another. Each time the censers emitted
smoke, they greatly consumed his Will, yet the help they provided was
very limited. Although the Red Loong could use it to fly again, the flight
could never compare to that of the old days. He could only reside wearily
among the claw-woods.

Alas, to think that the world harbors such vexing realities. A skill once
mastered can fade with neglect. Such is the nature of all knowledge: if not
applied, it withers away to nothing in the end. How lamentable!

![The Red Loong](/image-20240828215422264.png)

## Elder Jinchi

> With empty hands, he preached, yet gold was his quest,
> He left no wealth, just doctrines to attest.
> A life of greed, his doom was sealed tight,
> If deeds were weighed, would he still face his plight?

After two months of peace, Tang Monk reined in his horse. He saw towers
and halls nestled deep in the fold of the mountains. At the gate of the
place, they saw that it was indeed a temple.

The master and his disciple exchanged greetings before passing through
the mountain gate. In the main hall, they saw the name of the place:
"Guanyin Temple". Tang Monk was overjoyed, but Monkey said, "Master,
this is no good place. Better to leave soon." But the monk wouldn't listen.
He knelt before every golden statue he saw in prayer, and the monkey,
impatient with his master's attitude, began to strike the bell incessantly,
startling all the monks in the temple. Those from the upper and lower
halls all poured out.

The monks greeted Tang Monk. Monkey used his See-through Eyes to
look around and laughed, "Why do you monks here look so sickly and
Weak, with your spirits drained? Have you broken the precepts?""
In Tang Monk's perception, the monks all wore brand-new kasayas and
had tall, sturdy bodies. He considered Monkey's words to be mere
nonsense and remarked, "Don't speak so recklessly." Then, he turned to
apologize to the monks. The monks themselves regarded Monkey's words
as nonsense as well. Only two small monks, hidden in the crowd, dared
not reveal themselves.

The Elder of the temple invited the master and disciple to the back
chamber for tea. After the monks had taken their seats and the feast was
laid out, the two small monks assisted the elderly monk inside.
Tang Monk bowed respectfully. The two exchanged a few pleasantries,
and Tang Monk inquired, "May I ask about your esteemed age, venerable
elder?" The old monk replied, "Despite my many mistakes, I have lived to
see my two hundred and seventieth year." When Monkey heard this, he
laughed and said, "Old skinflint! Why do I smell yaoguai in this temple?"
The old monk did not answer. Tang Monk hastened to interject, "This
disciple of mine can be somewhat unruly at times. Please, do not take
offense."

A small monk was just then using an exquisite vessel to pour three cups of
fragrant tea for them. Monkey stared at him and said, "Where are you
from, little monk?" The small monk set down the tea and swiftly hid
behind the old monk. Biting his finger, he said, "This one has a furry face
and a strange head. He's a bit scary."

Tang Monk glanced at Monkey and said, "Mind your words! Don't offend
people with your brashness!" He then shifted the conversation by praising
the tea and the vessels.

The old monk didn't seem to mind. Instead, he asked Tang Monk, "Noble
sir, hailing from the Emperor's capital, might you have any treasures that
you could lend me for a mere glimpse?"

Tang Monk declined repeatedly, but Monkey laughed and said, "Master,
isn't your kasaya itself a treasure? Why not allow him a glimpse?
All the monks laughed. Then they brought out twelve cases of kasayas,
unfurled them, and hung them up for Tang Monk to see. But Monkey
laughed and said, "Very well, very well. Put them away. Bring ours out for
a look too."

Tang Monk grabbed Monkey and tried hard to stop him, but Monkey said,
"Do not fret! Do not fret! I know what I'm doing!" Without more words,
he took out the kasaya for the monks to see.
As the old monk gazed upon such a wonder, his spirit was touched. He
walked up to Tang Monk and knelt with tears in his eyes. "This humble
monk is verily bereft of fortune. My eyes are dim and clouded. I cannot see
it clearly."

Monkey laughed again and said, "And how do you intend to inspect it
clearly?" The old monk replied,"If you would be so kind and trusting,
allow me to take it to the back chamber and study it carefully overnight. I
shall return it to you tomorrow morning before your departure. May I
know your thoughts on this?"

Upon hearing this, Tang Monk was startled and chided Monkey. Monkey
laughed and said, "What are you afraid of? Let him take it for a look. If
anything goes wrong, I'll handle it."

## Black Wind King

> The future's dark, destiny's winds may shift,
> Each rise and fall comes in its drift.
> Once a guardian of the southern sea,
> Greed turned him to a slave of misery.

Since his return from Guanyin, the Black Wind King's spirit brimmed with
grand plans. He vowed to restore his might in the mountains. He knew
well that after years away, to win respect from the yaoguais, strength
alone would not make them bow. So he took many steps to try to earn
both awe and loyalty.

When he was with Guanyin, he learned the mantra of revival. Harnessing
the voluntary self-sacrifice of wolf guais, he brought back old Lingxuzi
from death. But that ungrateful old wolfleft only a few words after the
revival and vanished from his sight again.

The Black Wind King feared the wolf pack would fall apart without a
leader. He had to choose another wolf to head the pack. A grey wolf guai
who wandered here from Shituo Ridge, strong and in his prime, was a fine
choice. The Black Wind King gave him the name of Lingxuzi and helped
him take the seat. Yet, the wolf pack rose against their new master in the
temple, and it almost led to a bloodbath among kin.

In his frustration, the Black Wind King used the mantra to try and bring
back to life the old monk he used to practice with. But the soul of the
monk did not return to the stitched corpse. Instead, it fused with the gold,
silver, and copper coins the monk had buried in life, forming a maddened
golem. It wandered and disturbed the mountain garrison day after day,
never relenting.

The newly appointed White-clad Noble is far from ordinary. He typically
indulges in solitary reading and poetry. Despite his outward appearance of
loyalty and sincerity, he remains shrouded in mystery, making it
impossible for others to fathom his true intentions

Alas, to think too highly of oneself and then end up achieving nothing. It is
true that they say, a fool with ambition is worse than a nobody.

![Black Wind King](/image-20240828215507418.png)

## Black Bear Guai

> In Guanyin's grove, his greed won't cease,
> Southern tides bring no release.
> Schemes cloud his sight,

On Bodhi Peak, he learnt life's worth is peace.
In the Purple Bamboo Grove where Guanyin resided, life was usually
tranquil. The Black Bear Guai spent his days eating bamboo shoots with
aster and drinking homemade bamboo leaf brew. His days had become so
unremarkable, they almost faded into nothingness.

One day, the Loong Princess paid him a sudden visit with Red Boy, her
servant. Flustered, the black bear hastily gathered his dishes, trying to hide
the mess.

The Loong Princess rolled her eyes and asked, "Have you thought about
the task Guanyin mentioned to you a few days ago?"

Black Bear Guai didn't answer. He simply retrieved a box out of the chest
and handed it to the Loong Princess. Red Boy snatched it and opened it.
Inside was a transparent, honey-fried sugar sculpture of an immortal
riding a lion, known as a "lion immortal candy".
"Yesterday, there was a Dharma assembly. At the top of the feast, there
was this exquisite and eye-catching sugar sculpture. I specially saved it for
you, as a token of my respect."

"Do you presume to understand my tastes? Keep this for the children."
Hearing this, Red Boy lost interest and stuffed the box back into Black Bear
Guai's arms. Only then did the Loong Princess let out a contemptuous
laugh.

Cognizant of his blunder, Black Bear Guai mumbled, "I'm willing to serve,
but my abilities are mediocre. I'm afraid I can't handle such an important
matter..." The Loong Princess replied, "Do you think we don't know that?
Don't worry, there will be those fiercer and more ruthless than you
leading the charge."

"No work, no reward. If it's a thorny matter, I might not be able to handle
it."

"Guanyin will attend to all. No thorny matters shall prevail."

"Do not try to fool me. Guanyin instructed me to practice quietly here.
Why would she intervene?"

The Loong Princess wore a long face and said, "How can you be so timid?
This is a great opportunity. More people are vying for it than you could
even imagine. Guanyin chose you only because she wanted someone she
could trust. Can't you see that?"

Black Bear Guai was speechless for a long time. The Loong Princess had
run out of patience. "So little ambition. Forget it! Forget it! I'll let Guanyin
know."

"Dear Princess, honorable Princess, that's not what I meant. I'll go!"

Only when she saw the eager look in Black Bear Guai's eyes did the
princess roll her eyes again. Leaving Red Boy behind, she drifted away.
Seeing her leave, Red Boy hastily asked Black Bear Guai, "What exactly is
this task? I want to leave. Why don't you tell Guanyin and take me with
you?"

"It's a matter of great importance. But as you just heard, Guanyin didn't
want you to go. Don't pester me anymore. I don't want to lose this
opportunity for your sake."

A few days later.

Black Bear Guai had finished his preparations. Wielding a black-tasseled
spear, he was about to set off. Red Boy, who had been waiting outside the
bamboo grove for days, hurriedly caught up with him and once again
insisted on accompanying him.

Contrary to his usual manner, Black Bear Guai tried to persuade him, "Red
Boy, Guanyin has instructed that you must stay here. Even your father has
been pressed into service this time. Surely you can see how perilous it is;
this is no laughing matter." He touched the Encaging Band around his
head and sighed, "To risk one's life just to remove a headband? It's not
worth it."

With that, he transformed his body into a black wind and swiftly vanished,
paying no heed to Red Boy's desperate shouts.

Afterward, Red Boy waited for him outside the bamboo grove for a long
time, but he never saw him return. Later, when Red Boy recalled, he
realized that it was the last time he ever saw Black Bear Guai in Guanyin's
place.

## Tiger Vanguard

> Majestic and grand, with a fierce display,
> Striped coat, eyes like lightning's ray.
> In the blood pool, its wrath does rise,
> With a bronze head and iron tail, it terrifies.

The tale began centuries past, when the journeyers crossed Yellow Wind
Ridge. In those days, the old Tiger Vanguard lost his life seizing the Tang
Monk. He left behind two sons who, once orphaned, had to fend for
themselves.

The mountain groves lay in ruins. The tiger brothers led the remaining
lesser guais in a bitter struggle for survival. Fortunately, their father had
taught them enough to make a living. As the sandstorms ebbed, rock guais
slowly restored the groves to their former state. The elder tiger, following
his late father's ways, governed the yaoguais in the mountain. Each knew
their place and dared not prowl forth to prey on the living. Later, mortals
drawn by the lush peaks and clear springs built a village amid the slopes.
The elder tiger gained renown as a deity in the mountain with the
principle: "Devour the evil and shield the good."

The villagers built a Crouching Tiger Temple for the brothers, offering rich
tributes that made their lives even more blissful. Yet long had the younger
nursed a grievance; his elder brother reaped all the glory in people's words
on the tigers in the mountain. He believed his brother earned this merely
by dint of a few more years of life.

Another century turned and Yellow Wind Sage returned to Yellow Wind
Ridge with a host of rat guais. The younger tiger declared that it was the
Sage's negligence that had doomed their father. He clamored to slay the
Sage in vengeance, urging his brother to drive off the rats. Deeming this
just, the elder agreed. But in that fight, the Sage unleashed a vessel like a
bodhisattva's severed head, with its gale sharp as an edge. In a single clash,
the younger tiger fell grievously wounded. For the life of his little brother,
the elder tiger at once cast down his arms and knelt in surrender. The Sage
held no grudge, after learning the brothers' origin, he even bestowed
upon the surrender the title of Vanguard.

When the younger tiger woke and learned his brother now served as the
Vanguard, he seethed in disbelief. The brothers quarreled bitterly until
the younger stormed off, severing all ties with the only family he had left.
In the Tiger Vanguard's eyes, that yellow-furred rat had twice destroyed
his family and left them broken and scattered. He hated him for that, but
he was no fool. As long as the rat had protection from the higher ones,
what more could a tiger do beyond venting his rage by devouring a few
lesser rats each day?

## Stone Vanguard

> Stone forms the mountain's bones, firm and true,
> Earth's essence, prized for all it can imbue.
> Its back bears towering rocks, reaching the sky,
> Lofty in stature and majestic in height.

Ever since the Yellow Wind Sage bestowed the Buddha-headed stone
guai's essence upon the two mountain deities, they consumed it and
gained human hearts and forms. The union of the two resulted in the birth
of a stone child. Thus, the yaoguais referred to them as Father of Stones,
the Mother of Stones, and Son of Stones. Later, the Father of Stones left
the mountain for some reason, and the Son of Stones went in search of
him, leaving the Mother alone.

The Mother of Stone was never fond of violence. When the Yellow Wind
Sage gave her the essence, he entrusted her with the task of diligently
taking care of the mountain's inhabitants. She took this responsibility
seriously and worked hard. When the Journeyers passed through Yellow
Wind Ridge, the Yellow Wind King captured Tang Monk, forcing Sun
Wukong to seek Bodhisattva Lingji's help to capture him and take him
back to Mount Lingshan. Years passed, and upon the return of the Sage,
the ridge was populated with many stone guais. Among them was a
particularly strong and robust stone guai, which he learned was created by
the Mother of Stone with all her might to guard the cave.
One day, the Yellow Wind Sage personally came to visit Mother of Stone,
only to be blocked by the stone guai. Alarmed by their disobedience, he
feared it might become a threat. Hence, he summoned the newly
appointed Tiger Vanguard to eliminate the strong stone guai.

Tiger Vanguard agreed but was reluctant to fight them. They had once
worked together to rebuild the mountain, and he knew the strong stone
guai was highly respected by the other stone guais, who saw him as an
elder brother. He advised the stone guai, "Brother, we've endured much
to reach this point. If I can help, I will. I've arranged everything; you just
need to retreat into the valley and keep a guard on Shigandang, no need
for anything vicious. Today, I come with kind words, but tomorrow, it
might be a battle. Though we have some skills, we are no match for the
yellow-furred rat. Why not join me as a vanguard and keep things as they
are??"

The next day, the Yellow Wind Sage appointed the strong stone guai as
Stone Vanguard, ordering him to lead the stone guais to retreat and guard
the valley. From then on, the stone guais dutifully guarded the sealed evil
being and no longer meddled in the mountain's affairs.

![Stone Vanguard](/image-20240828215604878.png)

## Shigandang

> In the sea of bitterness, harsh winds bring the tide,
> Only those favored one can reach the other side.
> The fragrance of rained soil spreads far and wide,
> Yet dustless is the realm where the Buddhas reside.

Years ago, upon Yellow Wind Ridge, several cliff stones drank deeply of
the essence of sky and earth, basking in the energy of sun and moon. In
time, they awakened, transforming into sentient stone guais. Among
them, two, through advanced cultivation, were bestowed with the title of
mountain deities.

One day, for reasons unknown, several Buddha heads emerged from the
ground on the ridge. These heads, complete with eyes, ears, mouths,
noses, and even flexible muscles, were profoundly bizarre. Upon seeing
any living creature, they would scream loudly; and if approached, they
would swallow the creature whole.

One stone guai, finding these Buddha heads strange and dangerous,
decided to eliminate them to protect the mountain's inhabitants. It
rammed into one of the Buddha heads, crushing it into a pulp. However,
the flesh adhered to the stone guai's body and soon grew into a new stone
Buddha head.

From that moment on, the stone guai's temperament completely
changed. It began to roam the mountain, searching for other Buddha
heads, crushing them, and allowing them to grow on its back. As the
number of Buddha heads on its body increased, so did its size. It no longer
took nourishment from the universe but instead fed on the mountain's
living creatures to cultivate. The other stone guais could not defeat it; a
single punch from it would shatter them into pieces, destroying their
souls.

When the yellow-furred rat and his followers left the Kingdom of Flowing
Sands and passed through Yellow Wind Ridge, they encountered the
mountain deities leading several stone guais to drive the infested stone
guai away. The yellow-furred rat seemed to understand the nature of
those Buddha heads well. A strong sense of righteousness led him and his
followers into battle.

In a great victory, the yellow-furred rat not only destroyed the infested
stone guai but also eradicated all the flesh Buddha heads in the mountain.
He extracted the essence from the guai and divided it between the two
brave mountain deities. He also gouged out the eyeballs from the Buddha
heads and placed them in the valley as a seal.

The mountain's inhabitants greatly admired the Yellow Wind Guai. Seeing
that he could summon the wind, they named him the Yellow Wind Sage
and revered him as their king, settling with him in Yellow Wind Ridge.

## Black Loong

> With iron whiskers and devouring lips,
> Twin hammers held in fierce embrace,
> Lightning sparks powerful force,
> In thunder's roar, he holds his place.

Long had the fishermen beside the River Ji spoken of a black loong,
dwelling far beneath the waters in the Nine Depths. Upon its neck rested a
pearl of wisdom, said to grant great enlightenment to any who held it, a
prize beyond the worth of gold. Many had braved the depths to find this
fabled gem, yet few had been fortunate enough to return. With bitter
tears, they told of the perils below, of returning with nothing to show for
their trials, and worse, of facing the wrath of the fearsome loong prince.
Armed with twin hammers that summoned forth the fury of thunder, the
prince could smite those before him, leaving nothing but dust.

Long ages passed, yet still, there were those who sought the pearl. Among
the people, it was whispered that when the River Jiburst its banks and the
waters rose in wrathful flood, it was surely the doing of the loong prince,
his wrath roused by the trespasses of those who sought his treasure. In
hopes of appeasing him, they built a grand and splendid temple, where
they offered worship and tribute to the lord of the watery depths. Then
came a day when a young man arrived, clad in a midnight hue, with a
necklace of moon-pale stones around his neck. He named himself a master
thief with skills beyond compare. Though all cautioned him against
earning the loong prince's wrath, he paid no heed. With a single swift
dive, he set his course for the loong's palace.

To his surprise, he found the palace strangely silent and empty, with no
sign of the soldiers he had expected. A heavy sense of desolation hung in
the air. Puzzled, he went to seek the sea treasury and saw a sturdy, tawny-
skinned man sitting amid piles of chests, his brow furrowed in worry. At
the sound of his approach, that man, who turned out to be the loong
prince, stirred, dug a string of pearls from a chest, and tossed them on the
ground. "The pearl of wisdom you seek is not mine to give," he said in a
weary voice. "Take these if you must, and go."

Surprised, the young man asked, "The people on shore spoke of your
fierce temper, of how you strike men with your thunder or flood entire
lands for the smallest slight." The loong prince shook his head. "The flesh
of mortals holds no savor for me. Think you that I am some petty yaoguai,
to wreak havoc at my own whim? No, I would not dare to call forth the
smallest storm save at the bidding of those higher. Idle talk, all of it! My
own sire was condemned to the bite of steel for one trifling error. We
loongs, though our hearts are true as any, are treated with such
injustice...

The young man said,"I have heard of the Loong King's plight. A grievous
injustice, indeed. Is it for his sake that you find yourself in such reduced
circumstances?" Seeing he was no mortal, the loong prince said,
"Precisely. I have no wish to meet my end upon the Loong-Slaying
Terrace. I asked a fortune-teller, and he said if I hide well and kill some
westbound monkey, I may yet atone for my misdeeds and restore my
honor."

The young man pondered this. "A fortune-teller, you say? It was the
words ofa fortune-teller that led me to this place. There might be some
strange design at work in this meeting of ours. Why not go with me to
where I come from? It just so happens to be on the very road that leads to
the west." The loong prince was overjoyed, but the young man added, "1
ask no small price, however. All the treasures in your hoard, they must be
mine."

Since the day of the young man's arrival, fewer and fewer were those who
sought to plumb the river's depths in search of the pearl. Later on, the
tools of their quests were one by one set aside. And in time, the tales of the
loong prince far below and the pearl of wisdom he guarded were no
longer spoken of.

## Fuban

> Armored strong, with horns that rise,
> Burrowing brings endless human cries.
> A Buddha's head, yet ominous it seems,
> One side a saint, the other a fiend.

The Kingdom of Flowing Sands, abundant with gold, marked the sun's
daily demise.

The sun, truest of fires, plunged into the Western Seas, and the waters
boiled and hissed at its touch. Each dusk as the evening bell tolled, the
king sent men to the ramparts, where they beat upon a great drum and
sound clarion calls, thus neutralizing the noise of the seas, which would
otherwise be sharp enough to ravage babies in their cradles.

This drum, known as the Drum of the Setting Sun, was a gift from the
Buddha and granted peace to the common folk. In gratitude, they filled
their land with golden statues of all those enlightened, and the place came
to be known as the Buddhist Land of Gold.

Yet as the years passed, the people's reverence for the Buddha grew to
overshadow their regard for their secular ruler. This did not sit well with
the King of the Flowing Sands. The chancellor, sensing his displeasure,
petitioned for an end to Buddhism. And so the King decreed the razing of
temples, the banishment of monks, and even the change of the kingdom's
name.

Not long after, at dusk when the great drum was struck, a monstrous
insect erupted from the earth beyond the border. With terrible might, it
ravaged the humble villages, leaving untold dead in its wake. From then
on, the sound of the drum unfailingly drew that yaoguai from its den to
wreak new ruin.

The people declared this to be karmic retribution, the result of the king's
impiety. The chastened king halted his suppression of the Buddhist faith
and sent armies to slay the creature. Yet what hope had mortal men to
prevail against a foe so mighty and dreadful? After a bitter struggle, they
could only manage to frighten it back to its lair.

Fortunately, there was an enlightened monk, yellow of hair and garb.
passing through the land. This righteous soul could not bear to witness
woe and injustice and aided the armies in slaying the wicked insect. In
gratitude, the king honored him with the title of Royal Sage, and the monk
resided in the kingdom for several years.

In time, the Royal Sage took his leave and resumed his wanderings. Word
came that a bodhisattva, well pleased by his worthy deed, had taken him as
a disciple. He then founded his temple in Yellow Wind Ridge. "See how
the world favors virtue!" the king often remarked.

![Fuban](/image-20240828215701137.png)

## Yellow Wind Sage

> Endless yellow winds, sands stretch afar,
> In the land once abundant, no homes there are.
> Half-guai, half-immortal, who can decide?
> Thief or sage, why would he mind?

Firelight flickered over a table laden with food and drink.
The Second Prince of Flowing Sands, sitting on the table, gnawed on what
might have been half a haunch with relish.

The King of Flowing Sands sat beside his son obediently. As someone who
typically delighted in pointing out the missteps of others, he remained
oddly silent during the feast.

Even the Tiger Vanguard was on his best behavior. Watching the dimwit
across from him gorging on the haunch, the tiger seemed to have no
appetite.

The Yellow Wind Sage sat in the place of honor, one hand caressing the
object resting on the table: the head of a bodhisattva with eyes closed in
silence.

"Pa, I need more." The sudden shout from the Second Prince set all hearts
hammering. His pa, the King of Flowing Sands, glowered and hissed,
"Shut it!" Then he scrambled to his knees and pleaded for forgiveness.
"A trifle, is all." The Yellow Wind Sage rested his hand atop the head of
Lingji, then stood. "With my master's most prized vessel in my grasp, I can
surely absorb that thing. I mean to enter secluded meditation, starting
today. I have appeased those old rascals from above, yet it will be wise to
remain discreet"

"If you're seeking seclusion, Master," fawned the King of Flowing Sands,
"'my people and I would be honored to camp outside the cave and stand
guard beside you."

"Beside me?" The Sage gazed at his master's head and rejected his offer
immediately. "No, you will move to the ridge. I will be setting the Yellow
Wind Formation. Let no one disturb me."

"If..if there is urgent news, Master, how shall we bear it unto you?" The
King cried out.

The Yellow Wind pointed at the Tiger Vanguard. "Have your rock
brothers raise paths of sand, each with a gate locked by a secret tally. You
two vanguards will each hold a tally..."

Before Tiger Vanguard knelt to thank the Sage for this weighty charge, the
King interjected anxiously: "But Master! We rats have never got along
with those cats. If they hold the..."

The Yellow Wind Sage didn't want to listen at all. He picked up the
Buddha head and interrupted, "All of you, withdraw. Do not disturb me
until the very sky collapses."

## Kang-Jin Loong

> Halfway to the west, the journey long,
> Returning to the homeland, where dreams belong.
> Strengthen and weaken by the mighty sack,
> Principles falter, on a misguided track.

Kang-Jin Loong, one of the Twenty-Eight Constellations, is the second
constellation of the Azure Loong of the East. With a sharp horn on her
forehead, she once drilled through the Gold Cymbals to rescue the Great
Sage. Since then, the constellation officers have upheld the principle of
"staying sharp", leading many immortals to believe that some strange
influence had invaded their consciousness.

One day, during the roll call in the Dome of Stars, the Dawnstar was
missing. Despite thorough inquiries, no one knew his whereabouts.
Coincidentally, Yellowbrow returned to the New West to host a grand
ceremony, inviting various yaoguais, gods, immortals, and Buddhas to
attend. Hearing the news, Kang-Jin Loong sought permission from the
Celestial Court and attended the ceremony, intending to secretly
investigate the Dawnstar's disappearance. However, like the Dawnstar,
Kang-Jin Loong also vanished without a trace.

The constellation officers speculated and compared notes, realizing that
both the Dawnstar and Kang-Jin Loong had once done the Great Sage big
favors. They suspected a connection with the Great Sage. Reflecting on
their past interactions with the Great Sage, they grew fearful. Kui-Mu
Wolf scoffed, "Though that monkey ruined my plans, I still respect him.
But you all, who always boasted about your friendship with that monkey,
why are you silent now?"

![Kang-Jin Loong](/image-20240828215747002.png)

## Kang-Jin Star

> Loong maiden, Kang-Jin fair, White horns by emerald sea.
> Ambition beyond mortal care, Grace unmatched, wild and free.
> Black and white entwine, Old friends hard to find.
> Under wind's blade and frost's cold blow, She dances still in swirling
> snow.

Despite Kang-Jin Loong's long wait, no constellation officer defended to
her aid.

Yellowbrow laughed, "You, young lady, your high opinion of yourself is
precisely why you've ended up like this, an utter loser."
Kang-Jin Loong replied, "As long as I haven't begged for mercy, winning
or losing is irrelevant."

Not antagonized, Yellowbrow said calmly, "You wouldn't take such a risk
just for that lookout cockerel. You must be curious about that monkey."

Kang-Jin Loong remained silent.

"1 do have something of that monkey's, right here in this sack." With that,
he untied a sack from his waist.

Kang-Jin Loong recognized it as the sack that had once captured them and
scoffed, "What's so special about it? It's not like I haven't been in it
before."

"Well.. If you really want to know about him, you'll have to see for
yourself." With that, Kang-Jin Loong was sucked into the sack.

As she entered the sack, she seemed to see a ten-tailed goldfish swimming
towards her.

Not long after, when Yellowbrow released her, the constellation officer
had become dazed and bewildered.

Seeing this, Yellowbrow laughed heartily, "Well, is he still the hero you
remember?"

Kang-Jin Loong asked, "Is he, along with all the gods and Buddhas in the
Celestial Realm, all like this?"

Yellowbrow neither confirmed nor denied it.

After a long while, Kang-Jin Loong suddenly knelt on the ground and
uttered, "Please, Master, accept me as your disciple..."

## Captain Wise-Voice

> "The Voice enlightens all."

For pride and wisdom, you lost your debate.
In ecstasy beyond measure, your true self is complete.
The waves of dharma, flooding, engulfing, overwhelming.
Your mindfulness is lost in the world of evil.

You question the sky, the earth, and Buddha ,
One wrong step and every step thereafter repeats.
Here the winner loses, the losers win. The risen falls, the fallen rises.
You know how to save the lost in evil's heartbeat.

May your body serve this land since
The teachings of golden form shrouds all beings in their deceit.

## Cyan Loong

> With a sharp sword, Loong's Light it is called,
> Fishing alone in the bitterness, nothing caught.
> The hidden loong waits to soar the sky,
> Infallen to the dust, its fame will fly.

The boundless Bitter Lake, the Buddha's ferry saves only the willing.
Without the willingness, nothing can be done. The Cyan Loong, fishing
alone on Turtle General's back, is one such case.

When the Cyan Loong arrived in the New West seeking refuge, he briefly
encountered Yellowbrow. Disliking Yellowbrow's teachings on the path
to bliss, which he deemed utter nonsense, he knew better than to offend
him if he wished to stay in his domain. Thus, he claimed his intention to
fish in the Bitter Lake. If he could catch a living thing, it would signify his
bond with ultimate bliss, granting him the right to remain in the blessed
land undisturbed.

Yellowbrow knew this was merely a stalling tactic but found the idea
amusing and agreed to it, with one condition: once the fishing rod was
cast, it could not be moved, so as the fisher. If he moves, it would prove
that the Cyan Loong had ulterior motives and was deceitful, and he would
be immediately captured and sent to the dungeon.

The Cyan Loong readily agreed and kept his word. He transformed his
Loong Light Sword into a hookless fishing rod, sat on the turtle's back, and
did not move again.

Every day, the lesser guais would come to the turtle's back to check on
him, expecting that he would not last long in the cold and hunger. But
each time they came, they only saw the snow accumulating thicker and
thicker on his body until it completely covered him. The guais could not
understand why he would endure such hardship when a simple bow, or a
bit of minor contribution to Yellowbrow could earn him a comfortable
life.

Ah, there truly are people in this world who would rather endure a
thousand hardships than abandon their lofty aspirations. They carry a
World of their own in their hearts, unmoved by their circumstances.

## Yellowbrow

> Indulging in desires, I am carefree,
> No fears, no sorrows, just pure glee.
> In land of bliss, at the Eight Precepts, I laugh with delight,
> Inherent nature blooms, a tower of light.

In the West, on the peak of Mount Lingshan.
Two men sat facing each other. Clouds billowed, and the air crackled with
tension.

The young monk looked up at the sky, then pressed his palms together and
bowed to another monk with brows yellow. "Our masters are all here,
brother. Are you ready?"

The yellow-brow monk smiled and returned the bow. "I have been ready
for some time."

The Ullambana Assembly, held once every five hundred years, had come to
the stage of debate for graduating disciples.

The young monk raised a hand, signaling his brother to ask the first
question.

"Tell me, brother," said the yellow-brow monk, "what is the meaning of
life?".

"To seek truth," replied the young monk.

"And what is truth?""

"The way all things move, the primary law of the universe."

The yellow-brow monk said nothing but brought out a flower. Its petals,
first drooping, gradually unfurled in glorious bloom.

Gazing at the flower, he said, "Observe it. By following its nature, it
undergoes such wondrous changes."

He then gently sniffed the flower and said, "Every flower that blooms
releases a unique fragrance. This is the essence of its life, bursting forth for
its own propagation.."

He let go, and the flower drifted away. "To feel such a moment to the
fullest, that is bliss."

The young monk shook his head. "A moment's pleasure leads to an
eternity of pain. One will be trapped in the cycle, never at peace."

The yellow-brow monk said, "On my recent journey down the mountain, I
saw parents who, driven by hunger, exchanged their children for food. I
saw dissolute sons of wealthy families who, consumed by lust, brought
ruin to the moral order."

The young monk frowned, looking at his senior brother.

The yellow-brow monk continued."I saw learned scholars who, craving
glory, suppressed the dissents. I saw great generals who, thirsting for gain,
massacred entire clans."

The young monk remained unshaken. He said evenly, "Brother, do you
not see? Those parents who traded their child for a meal will regret it all
their lives. Those dissolute sons, living without restraint, died in an instant
with their joy. The scholars who suppressed dissent, once they fell from
power, were reviled by all. The generals who loved slaughter, they could
never rest easy, undone by their own sins."

The yellow-brow monk retorted, "Nonsense!"

The young monk was slightly taken aback. "Nonsense?""

"Their struggle, their joy, their determination, and their pleasure. Their
endless cycle of sorrow and ecstasy never ceased, and never sated!" said
the yellow-brow monk, "And this is the very source of the boundless
vitality across the Three Realms. How then should it not be the true
meaning of all life?"

"And those who set themselves up as false idols. Given time, their
pretensions are always unmasked. They become a joke in nursery rhymes
and a laughingstock in the pages of history."

"Brother? Why do you praise the suffering of karmic cycles, as you spurn
the truth of liberation and enlightenment?"

The yellow-brow monk said, "Brother, without joy and sorrow, what is
there to enlighten?"

The young monk said, "Where lies enlightenment? It is but suffering, plain
and clear."

The yellow-brow monk bellowed, "In pain, one finds revel, and in revel,
pain! Without both, there is no redemption!"

## Violet Spider

> Once she rode the cloud chariot to the high terrace,
> Now she dwells in a secluded cave by the mountain base.
> The breeze by the frail bridge chills her delicate frame,
> Spring arrives, another bridal gown newly made.

Upon reaching a cluster of huts in the forest, Tang Monk decided to seek
alms for food. As he approached the village, he saw several women playing
with balls under a pavilion. Invited by them into their home, he was
suddenly thrown to the ground, tied up with ropes, and hung from a
beam in the most uncomfortable manner.

While climbing trees and branches, Sun Wukong turned back and saw a
glimmer of light, realizing that his master must have encountered
yaoguais. He summoned the local keeper for details and learned that the
glimmer was from the celestial bathing spring, which had been taken over
by seven spider guais. Knowing that they bathe three times a day, Sun
Wukong transformed into an eagle, swooped down, and stole all of their
clothes from the rack.

Bajie, seeing so many women's clothes, persistently inquired and learned
that seven guais were bathing. Overjoyed, he rushed to the spring.
Without any hesitation, he stripped off his black garb and jumped into the
water, transforming into a catfish guai. The spiders tried to catch him yet
none of them succeeded.

Recognizing one of them as an old acquaintance, Bajie mischievously
swam around her legs. He floated and dived around her until he was out
of breath and hazed.

The guais, retreating to their cave, fetched some old clothes and called
upon their seven adopted sons to guard the house while they headed to
the Temple of Yellow Flowers to seek aid. Meanwhile, Bajie retraced his
steps and reunited with the fellowship. Together, they defeated the insect
sons and freed their master. Without delay, they hurried to the Temple of
Yellow Flowers. The temple master, who had practiced alongside the
seven spider guais, learned that Tang Monk was a monk of ten lifetimes'
merits and that his fellow spiders were humiliated, prepared four cups of
poisoned tea, intending to exact revenge on the fellowship and ultimately
consume Tang Monk.

However, Sun Wukong saw through the ruse, overturned the tea cups,
and defeated the spider guais, forcing them to retreat. The Daoist master
then engaged in, prompting Wukong to order Bajie to eliminate the seven
spider guais in his stead. Following his command, Bajie wielded his rake
and struck down each of the spiders, sparing only the last one.
Remembering their brief affair in the water, he hesitated and, with a final
thrust of his rake into the ground, told her to flee for her life.

## Yellow Loong

> In robes concealed, a loong lies,
> Trapped within the currents of life's ties.
> Soaring high, Golden Lining arise,
> Fate's trials from which none can hide.

The plan he had was simple: since the old man could foresee destiny, he
would surely sidestep misfortune. By staying with him, he believed he
could elude all danger.

After his brothers each fled to distant realms, he transformed into a loong
pattern on Yuan Shoucheng's robe.

For the next hundred years, he followed the old man across the vast lands,
watching him decipher omens and foretell futures. But what good did his
words change? Most, in their hubris, fell into the same snares.
Whenever this occurred, the old man would seek refuge in drink. By

fortune's grace, he possessed a gourd that brewed its own wine, and thus,
he often drowned his sorrows in a self-spun stupor.

In his drunken haze, the old man would often converse with the shadows.
At times, he would mutter wistfully, "What use is it to see through the
game if you cannot play it? And if you do not enter the game, what is the
use at all?"

At other times, he would be spirited and cheerful, exclaiming, "With life
and death are predetermined, so why not be bold and give it a try!"

Occasionally, he would speak with a heavy heart, "What's done shapes
what's to come. How many can truly defy destiny?"

And sometimes, he would sigh and question, "If you could predict where
you would die and deliberately avoid it, could you really escape?"

The loong often wondered if these words were meant for him. But since
the old man never exposed or drove him away, he assumed the old man
was just rambling in his drunkenness.

As time went on, these words gnawed at his heart, leaving him torn and
unable to decide whether to leave.

## The Scorpionlord

> In Bounds of Deity's Abode, sorrow's wine I sip,
> Golden armor, golden claws, poison's grip.
> Cockerel's crow, blood tears, body near to break,
> My love wanes and waxes like the moon, yet burns eternal like the sun's
> embrace.

The Mountain of Venom, neighboring the West Liang Kingdom of
Women, inherited its tradition of female supremacy.

The mountain was ruled by a Scorpion Queen, a Guai of Desire, renowned
for her enchanting beauty. She practiced the Dao of "Concentration",
excelling in bedroom arts and matters of pleasure, thus having countless
partners for her practice.

Among these partners was a male scorpion, adorned in golden armor and
claws, whose strong build earned him the queen's favor. Together, they
had a brood of scorpion offspring. However, none of the offspring were
female, which led her to lose interest in passing them her skills.
Consequently, the golden-armored male scorpion also fell out of favor.
Seeing that the queen no longer sought his company, the male scorpion,
with high self-esteem, took his children and moved outside the mountain,
severing ties with her.

Later, when the journeyers passed through the Kingdom of Women, the
Scorpion Queen, true to her nature as a Guai of Desire, kidnapped Tang
Monk, which cost her her life when Sun Wukong summoned the
Dawnstar, whose crow killed her instantly. Her maidens, the captives from
the Kingdom of Women, held in her cave, dispersed, taking all the
treasures with them. Still seething with anger, Sun Wukong set the place
ablaze, turning everything to ashes.

Sensing the fire, the male scorpion outside the mountain rushed to the
scene, only to find his former love stripped of her clothes, her tail severed,
and her body reduced to a bloody pulp, dead at the foot of the slope. After
much inquiry, he learned that it was the Dawnstar of Constellation Mao
that had killed her. With this knowledge, he vowed to avenge her.

Fortunately, the Guai of Desire had imparted some techniques to him. He
hence settled in the Pipa Cave, rebuilding her force and dedicating himself
to practice. . However, being male, he struggled to achieve great success,
leading to the decline of Mountain of Venom's reputation. Upon learning
that Webbed Hollow was the premier place for insect guais to practice, he
took his sons and sought refuge there.

## The Duskveil

> A brief song stirs the valiant heart,
> Long crows pierce the night apart.
> Leaping high, then falling low,
> Drifting like duckweed in the flow.

He lay on the ground, still unsure of how he had been defeated. The
previously unremarkable Daoist-robed insect guai, whom he had
previously dismissed as insignificant, now stood before him with a smirk
on this face.

Seeing the guai holding a radiant golden hairpin, he suddenly understood.
He wanted to ask a question but found he couldn't speak. The pain was
unbearable; it seemed that his throat was slit by the ville insect with the
hairpin.

He should be dying. He closed his eyes, not wanting his last sight to be that
hideous face.

Unexpectedly, someone turned him over and carefully applied decoction
to his wound. He could breathe again, but this brought him no relief.

The guai clicked its tongue in amazement. "The medicine Master gave is
truly remarkable. It has mended the severed part completely. What a pity
to use it on this one."

He opened his eyes and tried to ask a question, but the guai stopped him.
"Don't rush. External medicine can't heal internal injuries. Besides, I don't
intend to cure you."

With that, the guai waved its hand, and two fake Daoists in green robes
carried over a jade box covered with brocade.

The guai took out a golden cocoon and said, "We mountain guais are
unworthy of this item. It's best to test it on you."

Panic-stricken, he coughed up blood, which splattered onto the golden
cocoon.

The cocoon broke upon contact with the blood, and a worm with a human
head and a golden body emerged, quickly squirmed into the grass and
disappeared.

The guai remained unperturbed and pulled out another golden cocoon
from the jade box. "Master was truly wise to have prepared two golden
cocoons."

He tried to struggle, but his body was tightly bound by cobweb. The guai
commanded, "Pour it down his throat."

The fake Daoists brought several buckets of water and forced his head
back, pouring some foul-smelling concoction into his mouth. He felt
something go down his throat.

After swallowing it, he felt as if he were floating on clouds, his mind
becoming hazy.

Apart from a lingering concern for his mother, he could hardly remember
anything. He silently recited one last prayer, hoping that a glimmer of
survival would be bestowed upon his mother.

## Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master

> Tending the furnace, stoking the flame,
> Making pills, to immortality aspire.
> Countless eyes and countless schemes,
> One misstep, and shatter all dreams.

"Will this...work?" Violet Spider lowered her head, not daring to look
directly at Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master.

The master handed a needle to the old woman and said softly, "With what
the monkey left behind and this vessel mine, you have nothing to worry
about. If both fail, come to me, and I will back you up."

He paused, as if a new thought had struck him, and added, "If I act first,
you will never see that pig again...

Hearing this, the old woman quickly took the needle, thanked him, and
left.

Once the door closed, an immortal with a red scalp and a crane face came
in, holding a fly-whisk. He emerged from behind the screen, looking at the
master imposingly.

The master bowed respectfully and reported, "With that that pig in our
hands, the Destined One alone will not cause any trouble."

The Crane Immortal remained non-committal and sighed, "Your little
schemes are all under His Majesty's watchful eyes. He hasn't intervened
out of respect for Her Majesty."

The master chuckled dryly and replied, "Her Majesty's words: they've
taken too much profit. This time, our principal and interest must be taken
back."

The Crane Immortal flicked his fly-whisk as if shooing away flies and said
leisurely, "Once it's done, you leave. But they still have to stay."

No expression could be seen on the master's face as he bowed deeply to
the immortal.

## Yin-Yang Fish

> Black Yin fish, white Yang fish,
> Stirring storms with a sky-flipping swish.
> Leaping, twirling, never at rest,
> Boundless power in a bowl compressed.

In the South Sea, there is a fish over six meters long. Its dorsal fin
resembles a blade and can change color at will, whether white or black.
This fish can fly into the sky, creating massive winds and waves as tall as
mountains. Each time this fish appears, the village suffers from a plague.

Once, a fisherman returning from his catch encountered an elderly man
who could barely walk. Despite his frailty, the old man carried a heavy,
tattered bundle filled with scrolls. Exhausted and without money to pay
for a boat ride, he struggled along the riverbank. The kind-hearted
fisherman, seeing the old man's plight, offered him a free ride across the
river and even gave him two fresh fish for a meal. Grateful, the old man
performed a divination on the spot and said, "In a few days, a young man
wearing a bamboo hat and a white robe will pass by. Under no
circumstances should you let him come to your village. On the day he
arrives, do not conduct any business on the river, or you will lose your
life."

After delivering these cryptic words, the old man vanished from the boat,
leaving the fisherman both astonished and frightened. Yet, he etched the
old man's warning deep into his heart. A few days later, while fishing, he
indeed saw a man on the riverbank who matched the old man's

description exactly. The man, claiming to be weary from his travels, asked
the fisherman if he could take him to the nearby fishing village to rest. The
fisherman initially wanted to refuse but then decided to take the man to a
neighboring village downstream instead. After dropping the man off, the
fisherman docked his boat and dared not return to the river.

At that moment, the man pulled a black bowl from his sleeve and threw it
into the river. As soon as the bowl hit the water, a massive, pitch-black fish
emerged, and a fierce storm erupted, with waves surging sky-high. The
fisherman fled without looking back. Some time later, he heard that a
severe plague had struck the neighboring village, killing many people.
Initially feeling a sense of relief, he soon learned that refugees from the
neighboring village had brought the plague to his own village, and they
too were not spared.

## Bishui Golden-Eyed Beast

> With auspicious purple skin, a majestic sight,
> Mighty and fierce, like a tiger in fight.
> Ice and fire clash, a battle so dire,
> In scorching hills and frigid lands, a path of mire.

The Bull King sat on the mountaintop, utterly exhausted and unable to
move.

He watched as the Bishui Beast limped away from the battlefield. He
thought about calling out to it but decided against it.

His longest-serving mount had been heartlessly driven away by him,
without even a backward glance. His most trusted weapon had been taken
by his own son and discarded who knows where.

The Bull King glanced at the bloodstains on his body. His old wounds had
not yet healed, and now there were new ones. That brat's Firepoint skills
had improved again.

Initially, when the boy learned of his origins, he clamored for revenge
every day. Fearing that his son would bring about his own demise, the Bull
King had locked him up for a while and assigned the Bishui Beast to guard
him. Unexpectedly, Red Boy managed to escape, and by the time the Bull
King arrived, the beast had chased and fought him for quite a while,
leaving the boy pinned under its claws, barely alive.

It was the beast's fault for being so ruthless, forcing him to severely injure
it to save his son. What was wrong with that?

Fortunately, he had held back enough to let the reckless beast keep its life.
But who would have thought that the brat's injuries were faked?
Now, the tables had turned, and the son had imprisoned the father.
Retribution, it seems, does not come from the karma but from the hearts
of men.

"The one who wanted to save you, you drove away; the one who wanted
to kill you, you saved?"

A familiar voice echoed from the depths.

"Yes, you can save me, and I can save you too, but who will save us?" The
Bull King's head began to ache again.

![Bishui Golden-Eyed Beast](/image-20240828220145628.png)

## Red Boy

> On his red skin, talent may shine,
> Eyes glaring bright, a mischievous sign.
> Samadhi Fire forged, yet heart unrefined,
> The gate to Mount Lingshan lies within the mind.

For many years, Red Boy had been having the same nightmare. In his
childhood, he shared this nightmare with his mother.

"Mother, there were so many people, they were all coming to kill me!""

"My dear, once you fall asleep again, you'll forget all about it by
tomorrow."

Yet the boy was excited: "But I am very powerful. I defeated monks as tall
as mountains, strange birds, and fire-breathing statues... I am not afraid of
them at all."

"Oh, how brave you are, my dear!"

He continued: "1 dreamt that I grew up into an adult, with long horns on
my head and long spikes on my hands. I could kill a bunch of bad people at
once. But there were too many of them, I couldn't kill them all. Later,
some strange people I had never seen before came. They hung quietly in
the sky, not coming down, just silently watching me from above."

His mother pulled him into her arms: "If that day ever comes, your father
and I will go to the sky with you and kill them all."

"Will we die?"

"..."

"1 dreamt that they killed me, and I turned into a red lotus flower. And
mother, you picked this lotus flower, and I became your child again."

"..."

He continued to chatter: "Mother, if I die, would you be willing to give
birth to me again?"

"Don't you ever say this again!""

## Yaksha King

> Fangs bared, eyes like twin lanterns bright,
> In battle's clash, he finds delight.
> Agile and brave, with skills so fine,
> Yet lost and wandering, his fate's decline.

The raging flames had reached the Golden Hall, and the sounds of battle
outside were deafening, though they were muffled within.

The king, gravely wounded, sat amidst the wreckage, holding a recently
deceased young boy in his arms.

A figure stood behind the curtain, sighing, "'Such devastation.. Don't you
see? It's all because of you."

The king remained silent.

"Whether the Yaksha royal lineage continues or ends depends entirely on
your decision today."

The king couldn't help but glance around the Golden Hall, still able to see
traces of its former glory.

"They say Yakshas are the most resolute, yet you, as their king, are hesitant
and indecisive."

The king gently stroked his son's face, the body still warm. He wished so
dearly that the boy could see the vast and beautiful world.

"If you have even a shred of linger desire, why not try my method? The
unattainable wish in your heart, I will take care of it for you."

As a king, was he not even allowed to die on the battlefield? The king
closed his eyes.

Finally, he opened them and said slowly, "Since there is no salvation... I
will leave me and my son at your disposal."

"Splendid! It's not too late to understand it now."

The figure clapped, and a white-clad Daoist emerged from behind. The
Daoist approached the Yaksha King, bowed, then sat cross-legged on the
ground. He extended his hands above the boy's head and began to chant
softly. Before long, a small, blood-red lotus flower emerged slowly from
the boy's forehead, crystal clear and vibrant. The Daoist carefully plucked
the lotus and placed it into a bowl he carried.

The Yaksha King fixed his unblinking gaze intently at the lotus.

The figure said, "This red lotus is the essence of your son's soul. To ensure
it does not dissipate before successful reincarnation, we will need your life
and the water from the River of Childbearing."

The Yaksha King raised his arm, taking one last look at the blood lotus.

"I will do it myself."

## Giant Shigandang

On stone peaks, a divine birth is found,
Yet its dual hearts keep wisdom bound.
To shake the sky and earth seems light,
But only with schemes known, does fortune take flight.

In Mount Huaguo, after the birth of the Sage Stone Monkey, the remaining
celestial stone continued to absorb the essence of the sun and moon for a
thousand years. Through self-cultivation, it eventually transformed into a
yaoguai as large as a mountain.

This celestial stone originally possessed boundless divine power.
However, not long after its transformation, someone planted a fleshy
Buddha head on it. Since the emergence of this fleshy Buddha head, it had
constantly absorbed the Will from the celestial stone's body.

The celestial stone's spirit grew weary and had to burrow into the ground,
absorbing the pure essence of the earth to replenish itself. Over time, it
drained the surrounding mountains of their Will, causing flowers to
wither, leaves to fall, and all living beings to perish.
Meanwhile, the fleshy Buddha head, nourished by the celestial stone,
almost became the master of the stone body. Fully energized, it began to
develop the Skandha of Consciousness within. If it were to complete the
other four Skandhas, who knows how atrocious this celestial stone guai
would become.

Alas, this celestial stone, nurtured by the universe, ended up serving as a
mere vessel for the parasitic fleshy Buddha head. Perhaps this is what
people often refer to as fate and destiny.

## Whiteclad Noble

> A serpent youth in white, with furious gaze,
> Writes poems, dances, yet fierce in battle's blaze.

On a spring day, with a mild wind, in the Marsh of White Mist.
An old wolf brews tea over a stove. Watching the white reflection in the
Water, he mutters, "You and I should not be here."

The Whiteclad Noble, amid spear practice, hears these words. Swift as
thought, he hurls his spear towards the stove, and in another instant, he
flashes over, grips the haft, and stands poised before the aged yaoguai.

"Shall we sip blood, or tea?""

"Tea. Sit.""

They sit face to face. The old wolf hands the Noble a bowl of tea.

The Noble drains it in one gulp."A fine tea.""

The old wolf nods. "Does a razed mountain garrison warrant so many
schemes?""

The Noble replies, "I come at my brother's command. There are no
schemes."

The old wolf retorts, "My return from death. Was it not a scheme?""

The Noble says nothing. The old wolf gazes at him, also silent. Despite the
cloudiness in the wolf's eyes, his unease is apparent.

The Noble ponders for a moment, then finally answers, "That truly wasn't
a scheme."

"If not a scheme, then what was it?""

"Have you heard about that child in the Court? The Buddhas have a spell.

They piece together items that mimic the body, chant the mantra of
revival, and thus bring back a life."

The old wolf smiles bitterly and shakes his head. "That master, most
assuredly, wields no such power."

"Indeed, he does not. Yet the foul relic he obtained bears this potency.'

The old wolf says anxiously, "But living like this, I can barely sleep or eat in
"When doom is nigh, life may yet persist. When blessed with life, the loom
of death lingers. Breathe and make peace with it, and you may find your
tranquillity..."

The old wolf says nothing. The Noble lowers his eyes, also silent. For all
the uncanniness of his eyes, his compassion is apparent.

The old wolf says,"I'll leave this tea to you. Better to drink tea."

The old wolf rises with a sweep of his sleeve, sighing deeply. "Living like
this on their blood... how could I bear to do that?""

He totters away, not by the path he came, but turning down a fork in the
road beside the marsh.

"Tell the master he doesn't need to come see me anymore."

## Keeper of Black Wind Mountain

> A kind face veils his virtuous light,
> The benevolent eyes mask his might.
> To the one he grants a wondrous spell
> For that the story has yet to tell.

As stated in the Celestial Laws, a Keeper has the duty to observe the living
beings in his domain and nurture the soil and streams.

That day, as the Keeper of the Black Wind Mountain made his customary
rounds on the hills, tending to mortal concerns, he saw an aged Daoist
drawing near from a distance: a vestment embellished with stars, a herb-
gathering basket plaited from verdant creepers, a fishing drum tapped in
his hand, and a song about the lofty moon. In just a few steps, he glided his
way to the Keeper.

The Keeper looked closely and was sure they had never met. But judging
from the Daoist's white hair, vibrating face, and bright eyes full of
authority, the Keeper knew he was no ordinary mortal. Hastily, he greeted
the Daoist, "Daoist master, this humble Keeper pays his respects."

The old Daoist nodded slightly and passed his basket to the Keeper.
The Keeper took a look and saw that the basket was filled with rare and
mystical items, as well as miraculous herbs. He couldn't help but be
startled and asked, "How can a humble Keeper accept such a generous
gift?".

The Daoist smiled and said, "I was just passing through this place, but I
knew that soon, there would be a great upheaval in this mountain. I
thought the items in this basket would help you weather the storm for a
while, so I came to visit."

"What made you say this, sir?"

"1 have an old acquaintance with a bad temper. Although he has amassed a
measure of merit, I worry that with his arrogant nature, he shall find it
impossible to stay out of trouble. I fear he will bring great disaster upon
himself again...".

The Keeper thought carefully and said sincerely, "What can a humble
Keeper be of help?""
Seeing that the Keeper was quite astute, the old Daoist gestured for him to
draw near. He leaned in and murmured something into the Keeper's ear,
then instructed, "If you chance upon him in the mountain, pass on these
two spells. I cannot reveal myself, hence I rely on you to teach him, as a
means of honoring our bond."

The Keeper was immensely grateful and bowed deeply in appreciation.
The old Daoist returned the bow and was about to leave on a cloud. The
Keeper hurriedly asked, "May I inquire, Daoist master, from whence do
you hail?".

By the time the Keeper spoke, the Daoist had already vanished into the
distance. Aleaf floated down from the sky, its scent faint yet distinct, its
tip extremely slender and long: a bodhi leaf. At that moment, a revelation
dawned upon the Keeper. He bowed and paid his respects to the departing
silhouette until the clouds and mist obscured his sight, then turned to
depart.

## Man-in-Stone

> When fortune fades, speak not of past delight,
> In times of joy, recall the memories' blight.
> A single thought of greed can cloud the mind,
> Each step in anger binds, leaving wisdom blind.

According to common sense, the local keeper and the mountain deities
should work together harmoniously. However, this was not the case in
Yellow Wind Ridge.

Years ago, when the Yellow Wind Sage led his followers to subdue
Buddha-headed stone guai, he sought the keeper's assistance in battle.
The keeper, however, chose to remain a bystander. Consequently, when
the guai's essence was divided and distributed, only the mountain deities
received a share, leaving the keeper empty-handed and filled him with
resentment.

Knowing his own abilities were mediocre and lacking any significant
divine powers or backing, the keeper believed that obtaining the essence
would grant him great powers, akin to those of the mountain deities.
Thus, when the Father of Stones departed and the Yellow Wind Sage
surrendered, he harbored malicious intentions towards the Mother of
Stones.

He observed the valley for many days, noting how the stone guais were
busy moving mountains and shaping stones, while the Mother of Stones
merely issued commands from her stone cave. This gave him an idea.
One day, he transformed himself to resemble a stone guai and pretended
to be on an errand to approach the Mother of Stones. His plan was to ram
into her abdomen with all his might to, hoping to crack her open and
extract the essence. However, just as he leaped, the Mother of Stones let
out a piercing scream, and several stone guais emerged from the ground
nearby.

Distracted, the keeper missed his mark and only managed to create a crack
on the Mother of Stones' chest. Realizing his plan had been exposed, he
clung to her, attempting to absorb her power with all his might. By the
time the stone guais pried him off, he had absorbed half of her essence.
Enraged, the stone guais chased and attacked him relentlessly. The
keeper, unable to escape, tried to revert to his original form to fight back.
To his dismay, he found himself unable to change back, likely because the
stone essence had transformed him into a stone. The stone guais
continued to batter him until he was buried in the ground.

From then on, the keeper lost all hope and resigned himself to being a
broken stone in the valley. Yet, he still believed that if he could obtain the
other half of the essence, he might be able to transform back.

## Yellow-Robed Squire

> In silken robes that flutter bright,
> A long-snouted guai with eyes alight.
> Drunk with joy, he sleeps on tombs forlorn,
> His spear and armor, gleam like dawn.
> Windy, searing sun, a vast waste.

A headless monk and a yellow-robed squire rested together under a
withered tree.

The monk plucked at the strings of his Sanxian, his body swaying gently to
and fro.

"Enough," said the squire, rousing himself."Let's have some peace."

The monk's hand stilled. He edged away, then raised his hand to strum
again.

The squire hastily held out his drinking flask. "Have a drink?""
"With what mouth? I ain't got a head."

"Where is it?"

"Didn't ye hear the song?" the monk answered himself. "Gone! Someone
stole it."

"You should've kept better watch on your head. The fault is your own."

The monk turned away, making no answer.

The squire drew a piece of gold from his robe and showed it to the monk.

Though he had neither head nor eyes, the monk warned: "Mind how ye
swing about such a prize. Could have the thieves eyeing ye.""

The squire waved a hand. "1 don't have to worry. I'll come for you if it's
filched.""

"Me?".

"You're the only one I've shown it to. If it's gone, you will be the culprit."

The monk gave a dry chuckle, at a loss for words.

The squire gestured toward the horizon."There's gold aplenty there. Why
should you covet a mere sheet from me?".

"I ain't after yer gold. But tell me, what gold lies there?""

"You truly don't know? That was once a kingdom abundant with gold.

Gold from the gilded Buddha statues, all stripped bare."

"Even the gold on Buddha statues... Ye ain't a believer in karma then?"
"Ha! All those golden Buddhas never brought them any favor. It is plain
there is no such thing as karma."

The monk fell silent.

The squire sneered. Tipping his flask, he found it empty and then rose to
his feet. "I'm to await someone at the bidding of my Brother. If you want
more drink, come find me."

He tucked the flask on the side. "I'll go scrape off more gold and trade it
for a better brew. Then we can drink our fill!"

The monk tried to stop him, so he played the Sanxian, singing a song of
karmic justice.

The squire paid him no mind. With a wave and a laugh, he strode away
across the sands.

The headless monk's heart weighed down with disquiet. The yellow-
robed squire, however, went on his way, and the desert air rang long with
the peals of his laughter.

## Headless Monk

> Sanxian, sanxian, grief and rage untold,
> Defeated and demeaned by my follower bold.
> Confused, I saw kindness repaid with hate,
> The sands obscure the truth, the wind seals my fate.

In the days when strange winds first howled through Windrest, a curious
event unfolded.

Children of the village were at play near the village's edge, when haunting
chords from the Sanxian wafted through the air. Their young ears caught
the song's pleasant notes: "In a land o' bloodshed and chaos's sting.."
Intrigued and never having heard such a song, the youngsters raced
toward the musician. As they neared, they beheld a figure leaning on a
boulder-headless.

The children scattered in fright, all but young Chengda, who stumbled
and fell. As he lay, weeping and watching his friends flee, the Headless
Monk ceased his strumming. He emerged from behind the rock and
strummed once more. Invisible forces gently lifted Chengda, steadying
him on his feet. No longer fearful, the boy observed that, apart from the
missing head, this figure resembled the benevolent monks he'd seen in the
hamlet.

Seeing Chengda unafraid, the Headless Monk plucked another chord. A
cooling breeze passed over the boy's bruised leg. Looking down, Chengda
found his wound miraculously healed. Clapping in joy, he exclaimed,
"Magic! Magic!" The monk strummed again, and Chengda's torn trousers
restored themselves. With that, the monk returned to his eerie song:
"Yellow Wind Ridge, a mighty ole' range, once buzzin' with joy and
glee..."' and vanished into a gust of wind and sand.

When the villagers returned to save Chengda, they found him pointing at
the sand, exclaiming, "It was an immortal" The adults scoffed, "Nonsense,
what sort of immortal lacks a head? You've seen a ghost, boy!"

![Headless Monk](/image-20240828220523518.png)

## Bodhisattva Lingji

> From emptiness, desires arise, bringing strife,
> From compassion, lust grows, vast as life.
> Past joys turn to future regrets,
> Cleanse the heart, let go, as the wind sets.

The reasons behind Bodhisattva Lingji's beheading were widely debated.

Tiger Vanguard put it this way: "How could we, mere followers, dare to
discuss the master's affairs? However, I once heard my father mention that
our master despised that Bodhisattva of some sort. Their so-called
'master-disciple bond'. Huh, to me, it was more about merely seeking
protection. Being a yaoguai, you got to be pragmatic. Immortals and
Buddhas don't show mercy; it's all about mutual benefit."

The King of Flowing Sand seemed to know more details: "Years ago, when
Master helped my humble kingdom avert disasters, I caught a glimpse of
that big beetle. It had a Buddha head on its back, identical to the one
Master beheaded. Alas, everyone in my kingdom turned into rats later.
Master said it was a calamity he brought upon us and left with his
followers. I know he didn't want to leave; he always wanted yaoguais to
live dignified lives..."

The Second Prince was terse: "Master? Not bad. The Bodhisattva?
Deserved it."

Ma Tianba, passing through, sighed and said: "An oil-stealing rat climbs
high only if someone sets up a ladder."

The Yellow Wind Sage had only one comment about the matter: "Those
who bring disaster upon others will have disaster brought upon
themselves. If not by me, then by someone else."

## Turtle General

> Completing Xuanwu's name, the turtle and the snake,
> Cycles end and cycles start, the yaoguais they break.
> In frozen realms of ice and snow, they honor nature's call,
> United hearts in decay, better to die than living in pain.

The New West, above the Bitter Lake.

The Turtle and Snake Generals revealed their true forms. The Turtle
General, as massive as Mount Tai, landed in the sea, causing huge waves.
The Snake General, resembling the mythical Zhu Loong, coiled around a
mountain ridge, shaking the earth.

Yellowbrow showed no fear, wielding a Spikeshaft Cudgel, strong and
flexible, engaging the two generals in fierce combat. The Turtle sprayed
water, and the Snake breathed fire, almost gaining the upper hand.

Suddenly, Yellowbrow threw an object into the Bitter Lake, which
transformed into a ten-tailed golden fish. The fish grew rapidly upon
contact with water, entangling the Turtle General.

The Snake General intended to assist, but Yellowbrow untied a sack from
his waist, releasing a strange beast. This creature had a gilded body and a
Buddha's head, with sharp claws on its feet. On the shore, it engaged in a
fierce and evenly matched battle with the Snake General.

As the four clashed and shouted, Yellowbrow stood on the cliff, chanting.
Suddenly, a freezing wind howled, and a heavy snowstorm descended,
blanketing thousands of miles and freezing the lake's surface. Despite their
immortality, the Turtle and Snake were bound by their natural instincts to
hibernate in the cold. Gradually, they grew weary and exhausted, their
eyelids heavy with fatigue. After countless rounds, the Turtle General,
unable to endure any longer, sank into the icy depths of the water.

As he closed his eyes, the last scene he saw was the Snake General, unable
to escape the frost and icy blades, being cut into several chunks on the
shore...

## The Fox

> A fox beside the mountain stands, in sorrow deep and long,
> With caring heart and hopeful wish, for her savior to belong.
> With steadfast heart, it seeks the path, to rise and journey far,
> Yet fate unknown, her end draws near, before it sees the star.

According to ancient texts, a fox that lives for a hundred years can
transform into a human and gain knowledge of happening a thousand
miles away. After a thousand years, it can communicate with the ones
above and become a fox immortal.

There was once a young fox who harbored a deep aspiration to become a
fox immortal from a very young age. Driven by this dream, it practiced
diligently and tirelessly, never allowing itself to rest. In its quest for
knowledge, the young fox frequently sought advice from its kin, asking,
"How can I become a fox immortal?" Some experienced fox guais
responded with cautionary wisdom, saying, "Becoming a fox immortal is
no easy feat. Each year, the Lady of Mount Tai holds a rigorous
examination. Only those who demonstrate exceptional skill in both arts
and philosophy can ascend to immortality. Those who fail the examination
are destined to remain as ordinary wild foxes, forever barred from
achieving immortality."

The young fox asked, "But how can I excel in arts and philosophy? I don't
even have anything to write with."

The fox guai replied, "Once you can transform, you can take the form of a
beautiful woman or a handsome man and go to human towns to study and
learn. But remember this: the Lady of Mount Tai oversees all foxes and
despises those who seduce and consume humans. You must know that
absorbing human essence is the quickest way for yaoguais to become
powerful. If you wish to become a fox immortal, this path is forbidden, and
you must set off on much more perilous and arduous path."
The young fox said, "I understand now, but I am not afraid of the perils
and ordeals. I will discipline myself and follow the path to true
immortality."

From then on, the young fox relied solely on the essence of the sun and
moon for cultivation. Decades passed in the mountains. As she gradually
accquired the ability to transform, she often approached human villages to
observe their way of life. One day, it accidentally stepped into a hunter's
trap and was rescued by a young scholar who took it home...

## Green-Capped Martialist

> In tattered robes and a bamboo hat worn,
> Golden chakram through fire, a sight to adorn.
> Three times in snow, his Zen heart tried,
> Neither foe nor friend, just mischief implied.

Gray and white, ice and snow blanketed the entire mountain range.
In a deep valley, there was a peculiar cave with a lush green watermelon
field, thriving exceptionally well. A young monk was in the field, picking
melons, patting them here and there, but none seemed to satisfy him.

Next to the watermelon field stood a strange man wearing a bamboo hat,
watching the young monk pick watermelons. "My brother said that if
there's a chance, I can test the monkey on his behalf," he said,

The young monk finally picked up a watermelon, weighed it in his hands,
and smiled, "This one is good, ripe and sweet. The one you mentioned,
I've already checked him for you, he's good."

The strange man replied, "If I don't test him myself, I won't be at ease to
tell my brother about him."

The young monk exerted his strength and split the watermelon in half,
"Instead of feeling unease about him, I worry more about your brother."

The strange man pondered for a moment and said, "The thing is guarded
by my brother. There is nothing to worry about."

The young monk, munching on both halves of the watermelon, said
noncommittally, "That thing tests the bearer's heart greatly. He has borne
it alone for many years, let's hope he doesn't fail at the last moment."

The strange man quickly responded, "That's why, if this time that monkey
succeeds, wouldn't it be the best of both of you?"

The young monk stopped, looked up at the strange man, who quickly
bowed his head and apologized.

The young monk laughed again, waved his hand, and said, "Go, go. First,
pass my disciple's test, then we'll talk about the rest."

## The Third Prince

> In the Kingdom of Flowing Sands,
> His lineage held the throne,
> Chu-Bai Spear in hand,
> A prince of might well-known.

The Third Prince, renowned in the City of Pin, originally hailed from a
distant land before becoming a disciple of Bodhisattva Guoshiwang.
Bodhisattva Guoshiwang was famed for his ability to subdue yaoguais. This
was precisely the skill that the Third Prince sought to learn, as his
homeland was plagued by rampant yaoguais.

After the journeyers had bested the Yellow Wind Sage, the Third Prince
was relieved to learn that the sage had been sent back to Mount Lingshan.
This news allowed him to focus on his mountain practice undisturbed.
Later, whispers of another grand ceremony in the New West caught his
attention. With his master's permission, he set out with his four captains
to investigate, suspecting Yellowbrow of foul play. However, they were
met with a crushing defeat, as Yellowbrow had once again stolen his
master's Vessel.

"Master, we have suffered a resounding defeat. This is not the first
encounter we've had with him, and yet, here we stand, vanquished once
more."

"Master, a beguiling spell had taken me. I had to wound myself to stay
awake."

"Master, be warned: that old guai now possesses an immense gilded form,
which turns aside blades and spears with ease. Exercise utmost caution."

"Master, the four captains must have been bewildered by some evil spells.
Now, they have bowed before Yellowbrow and become his devotees."

"Master, my first captain debated with Yellowbrow and was deluded. Now
he sings beguiling chants in the dungeon to incite our surrender."

"Master, Yellowbrow twisted off my second captain's head. Into pus and
blood it turned. Yellowbrow's evil craft then transformed the blood and
pus into a lotus flower blooming at the temple gate."

"Master, the third captain threw his weapon at Yellowbrow, and
Yellowbrow broke the captain's limbs and reattached them with those of
others."

"Master, the fourth captain was struck by Yellowbrow's Spikeshaft
Cudgel. His body was pierced, and eyes grew out of every hole."

"Master, it was my command that led the four captains to attack
Yellowbrow. I was wrong; it's all my fault, all my fault."

The Third Prince, driven mad, having blinded himself and deafened his
ears, muttered incessantly in the dungeon. Could his master truly hear his
words spoken to the walls? Did he even have a master? Why had his
master never come to save him?

## The Keeper of the New West

> Divining fate, he plays his part,
> In worldly guise, a cunning art.
> He laughs at fools who seek their fate,
> For luck and doom, the heart dictates.

The Celestial Court often favored guais of plants and trees in the selection
of Keepers. The Keeper of the New West, however, was renowned for its
being a feathered deity of wind.

This Keeper, unlike others, cared not for tending the soil or sowing seeds.
Instead, he had a unique penchant for divination. Though he hailed from
the West, chanting sutras was not his calling. His true talent lay in the
ancient art of yarrow stalk divination, where he skillfully foretold fortunes
and misfortunes.

The New West was flanked by the Thorn Ridge to the east and the Seven
Perils Mountain to the west, both treacherous places scarcely visited by
travelers. Guarding this area, the Keeper compelled every passer-by to
have their fortune told. Under the guise of interpreting the divination, he
would set up intricate traps. Travelers, eager to avoid misfortune, would
unknowingly fall into the Keeper's schemes.

One day, a traveler passed through, and the Keeper, as usual, insisted on
reading his fortune. The reading revealed a bad omen. Terrified, the
traveler begged the Keeper for a solution. The Keeper, feigning mystery,
claimed to have a secret method to turn misfortune into fortune, but it
required a hefty payment. Desperate and believing him, the traveler
handed over all his money. The Keeper then directed him to a narrow,
winding path, instructing him to proceed quickly.

Following the Keeper's advice, the traveler safely crossed the ridge and
the mountain. Observing this, the Keeper laughed and said, "The art of
divination lies not in the omens but in the heart. Where the heart leads,
there lies fortune or misfortune."

The tale spread, leaving everyone amazed. From then on, those who
passed through felt fortunate to have their fortunes told by the Keeper.

## Zhu Bajie

> Born with a clumsy heart, trapped in life's advance and retreat,
> Breaking precepts repeatedly, following nature, not the Buddha's feat.
> With rake and tusk, smashing fate, burrowing karma's weight,
> Rolling in the muddy world, heedless of scorn or debate.

In the highest sky, above the Jade Pool.

Amidst the swirling clouds and mist, celestial maidens flitted to and fro.
Today, the Queen Mother of the West was hosting a lotus-viewing
banquet.

As Admiral Tianpeng walked past the gate, he saw a tall, burly man blocked
by a celestial maiden. "Admiral Curtainraiser," the maiden said in a polite
but cold manner, "without a handwritten invitation from the Queen
Mother, you cannot sit by the pool. If you don't mind, why not take a seat
in the side hall and have some tea." The burly man responded in
obedience, but his gaze fixed in the main hall.

At such behavior, Tianpeng subtly shook his head, a faint smile playing on
his lips. He presented his invitation to the other maiden at the gate and
strode in, his head held high.

The banquet was in full swing, with celestial officials exchanging toasts,
their joyful laughter resonating throughout the hall, creating an
atmosphere of mirth and merriment.

Tianpeng, an admiral who guarded the celestial river, seldom attended
such festive gatherings. However, he managed to greet everyone as if he
was well-acquainted with them all, all while mindful not to overindulge in
wine.

The God of Longevity stood beside the Queen Mother, stroking his beard
and chuckled, "Such extravagance. I wonder how would the Peach
Banquet surpass it."

A constellation officer, standing nearby, chuckled at the Elder's concern,
"Elder, such worries are in vain. With the allure of those nine-thousand-
year peaches, even a casual arrangement of tables outside the Celestial
Gate would draw the dignitaries from across the three realms, be they
noble or humble, eager to partake in a taste."

A red-faced immortal sneered, "It's not the peaches they seek, but rather
to bow before the Jade Emperor and the Three Supremes, and worship the
Buddhas of the west. Such assemblies are scarce pretexts for them to curry
favor and bask in the company of the divine."

The Queen Mother spoke with solemn dignity, "The Peach Banquet is no
trivial matter. Our gathering today is but a prelude, a rehearsal of the rites
and rituals that must be executed with exactness and reverence."

Upon concluding her speech, the Queen Mother signaled to the Lord of
Luna with a glance. With a few claps of his hands, a group of maidens
dressed in white entered the hall.

The maidens took their positions by the Jade Pool and began to play
instruments, sing, and dance. Among them, one dancer, with hair like
silver, and a dress like clouds, stood out with her exceptional grace.
Tianpeng had never seen the beautiful celestial maidens so closely, and he
was fascinated.

A celestial maiden in a violet gauze dress, holding an exquisite cup of wine
with both of her hands. "Admiral," she softly called.

Drenched in his fascination, Tianpeng took the cup from her hands, yet his
gaze never left the white dancing sleeves.

After the dance concluded, Tianpeng regained senses. He rose up to toast
the Queen Mother, yet the queue was long; by the time he reached the
end of it, he found himself already outside the gate.

Suddenly, he heard someone shouting, "Shoes! His shoes!"

He looked over and saw two celestial officers supporting a drunken
monkey as they hurried past.

Tianpeng thought to himself, When will I ever get to be as drunk as that
monkey?

## Venom Daoist

> Schemes and plots, hard to outsmart,
> Impulsive nature, a straightforward heart.
> He should thank his twin blades,
> One cuts through folly, one has the truth displayed.

Gentle mountain breeze, wildflowers-covered ground, inside the stone
cave behind the temple.

The purple-faced Daoist Master asked with a gentle smile, "How long have
you been in this temple?"

"I... I do not know. I can only remember that the thunder has struck the
hall over a hundred times," replied the Venom Daoist, standing cautiously
beside the master.

"Then it has been over a hundred years," the master said, walking towards
the bare stone wall, about to touch it.

"Master," the Daoist called out,"I have been here for a long time, yet you
have not taught me any skills. Could you perhaps teach me a few moves
today?"

"You wish to learn my skills?"

"Since the day I called you 'Master', yes."

"Your foundation is solid, and energy channels harmonized. Your have
already achieved high. I am afraid learning my skills won't help you
much."

The Daoist tensed up at the master's words, fully on guard.

Yet, out of his expectation, the master uttered, "skills, I can offer no more,
but some unique methods of practices, I can offer. Yet they are beyond the
minds feeble, and demand strong willpower to succeed. If you are not
deterred by hardship, I can let you try."

Intrigued, the Daoist asked, "What kind of unique methods?"

The Daoist shook his head and said, "Without your willingness to learn, I
cannot tell you that."

The Daoist pondered deeply, unable to make a decision.

The Daoist gently persuaded, "It is a path trodden by many of my disciples.
If you come here, attempt nothing, and achieve nothing, would it not be a
journey in vain?".

Hearing this, the Daoist remembered his brother's instructions and
inquired, "What can this method achieve?"

"It will refine your body, elevate your divine skills, and the path to
ascension shall be an ease!"

"Is it truly so profound?"

"If you find it not helping, you can stop at any time," the master said
confidently.

Moved by these words, the Daoist agreed immediately, "I am ready to
follow your instructions, Master."

"Come with me," the Daoist said, glancing once more at the stone wall
before leading the Daoist away.

## Crane Immortal

> In crimson-embroidered crown, pure and refined,
> Ascending to meet the immortal, unconfined.
> Revered in the vast skies, far and wide,
> What foolish man would dare not abide?

The newly appointed Dawnstar originally served in the Hall of Incense.
Now promoted, he had his first opportunity to tour the Celestial Palace.

As he exited the Celestial Palace, he was met by the Crane Immortal, who
first took him to the Celestial Gate to be introduced to the Captains of the
Court on duty and the Four Heavenly Kings. They then visited the Thirty-
Three Halls and the Seventy- Two Palaces, paying respects to everyone
along the way.

The celestial beings treated them with utmost courtesy, which greatly
pleased the newly appointed Constellation Officer. After the tour, the
Crane Immortal was about to personally escort the Dawnstar back to the
Palace of Illumination.

On the way back, the Dawnstar suddenly asked, "I wonder if my
predecessor was promoted or demoted. Could you enlighten me, so I may
know how to conduct myself in the future?"

The Crane Immortal smiled and said, "He mingled too closely with the
mortal realm, perhaps making some friends among the mountains and
wilds. Now, having shed his celestial bonds, who can say where he revels
in his newfound freedom?"

The Constellation Officer frowned and asked, "1 heard that the Dome of
Stars conducts roll calls daily. How could it be that the Constellation
Officer left without anyone knowing?"

The Crane Immortal gently smoothed the wrinkles on the Dawnstar's robe
and said somberly, "If he hadn't left quietly, how would you be here
now?"

Hearing this, the Dawnstar seemed to understand and did not pursue the
matter further.

![Crane Immortal](/image-20240828220917801.png)

## Hong Yi

> Tearful eyes reflect tearful eyes,
> Broken hearts echo broken cries.
> The world harbors the cold and sly,
> Yet spares this soul in serpent's guise.

The Jade Emperor sat on his throne in the Celestial Palace, gathering the
officials.

Hong Yi stood among the immortals and saw Taibai Jinxing leading in an
officer in. A crown of Five Peaks on his head, a Landscape Engraved Tablet
in his hand, he wore the light of the seven stars on his robe, and walked to
the pleasant music of eight jade rings dangling from his waist.

Taibai Jinxing then announced, "Your Majesty, I have brought the son of
Bodhisattva Pilanpo from the Purple Cloud Mountain as commanded."

The Jade Emperor responded, "Let the celestial official come forward. I
appoint you as the 'Dawnstar', ranking among the Twenty-Eight
Constellations, and grant you residence in the Palace of Illumination.
Remember to be diligent in your duties and conduct your patrols on
time." The newly appointed Dawnstar thanked the Emperor for his grace.
The Jade Emperor then ordered the Crane Immortal and the Supreme
Celestial Inspector to escort him to his post, also bestowing upon him two
bottles of imperial wine and ten golden flowers.

The immortals congratulated the Dawnstar, while Hong Yi stood quietly
on the periphery, observing for a moment.

She was slightly older than him, and having grown up together due to the
deep connections and frequent interactions between their families, she
had always seen him as a younger brother. Now, witnessing his moment of
glory, she believed his future held limitless potential.

After waiting a while longer, she watched him greet and bid farewell to
others in front of the hall, his spirits high, yet he never glanced her way.
With a quiet sigh, she turned and slowly walked out of the hall.

## Keeper of the Flaming Mountains

> The furnace crumbles, bricks fall, a day of disgrace,
> Lament did he, the beauty he could not embrace.
> All his talents wasted on the golden son,
> Looking back, he's become a foolish one.

The galaxy was clear, and the sky was spotless. That night, a young Daoist
boy sat by the furnace, fanning the fire. Feeling drowsy, he was about to
sneak in a nap when he suddenly heard a soft laugh.

Looking up, he saw his master standing at the door with a girl, watching
him doze off. He quickly straightened his clothes and stood up to
apologize. Contrary to his usual stern demeanor, the master did not scold
him. Instead, he called the boy over and briefly introduced the newcomer,
instructing them to guard the furnace together from now on. Finally, he
said lightly, "she is your senior. You may call her Rakshasi."

At first, the young Daoist boy was delighted to have a companion, but
upon hearing that the newcomer was a senior, he felt displeased. As soon
as the master left, he decided to make things difficult for her.

Handing her the fan, he said, "The furnace is now your responsibility. It's
only right that the older one does the work, isn't it, my senior?" The young
woman did not argue and simply smiled, "Indeed, my junior, you may go
rest."

The next day, when the master ascended the altar, the girl approached.
The young Daoist boy thought she was going to complain, but instead, she
said, "Master, as a new disciple, it is only right that I fan the fire. However,
the fan my junior gave me is a bit small and not very handy."

The master glanced at the young Daoist boy and smiled, "If that's the case,
I'll make a new one for you. You may as well wield it as a nice vessel."

The young Daoist boy had not expected his usually strict master to be so
kind to the girl. Gradually, he began to see her in a new light.

From then on, they practiced together. He discovered that the girl was
adept in both Buddhist and Daoist teachings. No matter what scripture the
master taught, she could always engage in discusssion, whereas he often
struggled to keep up, both in speech and thought.

Later, when the furnace was kicked over, he was severely punished by the
master. While other disciples looked on coldly, it was only this senior who
volunteered to descend to the mortal realm to help him.

In the mortal realm, he learned that his senior had her own cave dwelling
and a group of loyal followers. The master had even granted her the title
of Earthy Immortal as compensation.

Some time later, the master arranged for her to marry a yaoguai king in the
mortal realm. Though he felt a bit melancholic, he understood that he was
ultimately unworthy of her, no matter how many dirty tasks he had done
for the master. In the master's eyes, he would never be a match for her.

## Ma Tianba

> In life, a brave heart met a noble lord,
> Loyal and true, bound by a warrior's accord.
> Grateful and steadfast, he sought to repay,
> Unyielding in courage, keeping danger at bay.
> Ma Tianba was originally named Ma Er.

Flaming Mountains were scorching hot all year round, with not a blade of
grass growing around. Anyone attempting to cross the mountains, even if
they had a head of iron and a body of steel, would melt into a puddle.
Despite this, some merchants, driven by the lure of profit, attempted to
cross the mountains to trade horses in the west.

Yet, upon setting foot in the Flaming Mountains, they were beset by guais.
None survived, except for one horse, which bolted and ran for sixty miles
after sensing the danger. Exhausted and thirsty, it collapsed at the gate of
a manor. An old man named Xu, who lived alone in the manor, took pity
on the horse. He took it in, fed it, and cared for it. Gradually, the horse
regained its strength and grew robust.

The horse was intelligent and always responded to the old man's kindness
with grateful neighs. The old man, seemingly able to understand the
horse, said, "I was the eldest in my family. If you wish to join me, you shall
be called Ma Er, as my second brother." The old man treated Ma Er with
genuine affection, often going hungry himself to ensure Ma Er was well-
fed. Ma Er took note of this and remembered it in his heart.

The Flaming Mountains were in perpetual drought, and without the
Plantain Fan, there was no spring to sow and no autumn to harvest.
Moreover, Xu was getting on in years. One day, as he was feeding Ma Er as
usual, he suddenly collapsed by the stable.

Seeing this, Ma Er hoisted the old man onto his back and galloped towards
the Plantain Cave on the Emerald Mountain. He ran non-stop for over
seven hundred and seventy miles. Yet, by the time they reached the
Emerald Mountain, the old man had already passed away. Heartbroken,
Ma Er refused to return to the manor and began wandering the
mountains.

Seeing Ma Er's gentle nature, the yaoguais in the mountains often bullied
him. Ma Er endured their taunts and jests, never getting angry or speaking
back. Homeless and unbannered, he lived this way for many days, his once
robust body growing thin again.

One day, as he was scavenging along the mountain path for scraps
discarded by the lesser yaoguais, he saw an old bull sleeping by the
roadside, with fire burning on his fur. Alarmed, Ma Er tried to wake the
bull but to no avail. With no other choice, Ma Er hoisted the old bull onto
his back and ran towards the Plantain Cave.

Along the way, somehow, the yaoguais, seeing Ma Er carrying a burning
bull, were furious. They shouted and attacked, but Ma Er, ignoring them,
charged ahead, sustaining many injuries.

It was only when they finally reached the Plantain Cave that Ma Er
realized the burning bull was the Bull King, who had got drunk
somewhere with friends and was now in a deep sleep. With a few calls
from Rakshasi, the Bull King was startled awake from his drunken stupor.
Seeing the battered Ma Er, the Bull King laughed heartily, "You are one
tough horse! From now on, join my banner, and you shall be named Ma
Tianba!"

Thus, Ma Er became Ma Tianba. He trained and practiced martial arts
under the Bull King, growing stronger and eventually becoming a great
general under the Bull King's command.

## Pale-Axe Stalwart

> With axe in hand, the guard shows might,
> Fearing neither toil nor plight.
> Wishing for the mountain's peace,
> Braving dangers till the sun's last light.
> A bright afternoon, Camp of Seasons.

"Splendid! That's the morale I want to see," the Bull King exclaimed,
seated in the main camp atop the cliff, observing the bull guais training
below.

Standing beside him, the Pale-Axe Stalwart reported, "My king, only such a
powerful army is worthy of your majestic presence."

The Bull King nodded approvingly, saying, "You've done well, young
captain."

Looking at the Pale-Axe Stalwart, he said kindly, "You've not been under
my command for long, yet you've managed to train this mixed troop so
well. It's beyond my expectations."

The Pale-Axe Stalwart replied humbly, "When I first arrived and saw how
well-regulated the King's domain was, I was equally surprised."

Realizing he might have misspoken, he quickly apologized, "I meant to
say..."

The Bull King laughed heartily, "No worries. The well-regulated domain is
all thanks to the Lady of the House. Her strict rules keep these boneheads
in line."

The Pale-Axe Stalwart also laughed, "Indeed, I was initially taken aback by
her strict rules."

Seeing his straightforwardness, the Bull King praised, "You've done well
in managing the troops. I'll promote you to be my vanguard."

The Pale-Axe Stalwart quickly knelt, "Thank you, my king, for the
promotion. I will serve you with utmost loyalty."

Just then, a voice called out, "Father, why have you summoned me?""
The Pale-Axe Stalwart looked up to see a red-skinned youth approaching
from behind.

"I called you to observe how to muster and command troops. This is my
newly appointed vanguard; come and meet him."

The youth patted the Pale-Axe Stalwart on the shoulder and smiled, "Very
good. If my father trusts you, you must be capable. When I become king,
you shall be my general."

The Bull King clapped his hands and laughed, "Such ambition! The future
of this domain will depend on you."

The youth pondered for a moment and said,"Father, why not entrust that
item to me as well?"

The Bull King's face darkened, and he did not respond.

"Father, you trust me with the domain," the youth continued, "so why
not with a mere object? Ever since you obtained it, you've grown more
haggard. Mother is very worried."

The Bull King waved his hand dismissively, "Do not mention this again."
The youth, though puzzled, did not wish to defy his father and left
reluctantly.

## Pingping

> Born to a fate of trials and woes,
> Who pities the ebb and flow of those?
> Better to live in nature's embrace,
> Freely to wander, freely to repose.

After delivering her homework to her mother, Pingping went to the
Height of Ember. Her brother had asked her to meet him there, saying he
had something important to discuss.

When she arrived, she saw Red Boy standing with his hands on his hips,
directing Quick as Fire and Fast as Wind to burn the bull guais to flee as his
way of training them. Amused at the scene, he laughed loudly and
boisterously.

"Brother," Pingping called softly. Ever since Red Boy returned from
Guanyin's tutelage, she felt he had changed. Every time she spoke to him,
a subtle fear tugged at her heart.

Upon seeing her arrival, Red Boy waved to halt the training and turned to
her, "Pingping, let's engage in a game," he proposed,"You will run, and I
shall chase you. Let us see if I can catch you before an incense stick burns
out."

In the past, Pingping would transform into a little fox, leaping through
rocks and crevices, always having the upper hand. Yet this time, Red Boy
shattered her hiding rocks with a single spear thrust, scorched her
standing deadwood with a breath of fire, and flew over the cliffs she
jumped across as a red cloud.

In less than half the time it takes for an incense stick to burn, Red Boy
effortlessly caught her and sighed, "Mother's teachings are still too
gentle."

Seeing his sister's gloomy face, Red Boy took her to rest by the cliff in the
Furnace Valley. To cheer her up, he twirled his Firepoint for her
entertainment.

Seeing his little sister clapping and cheering, Red Boy asked, "How do you
think my skills compare to Father's?"

Pingping couldn't answer. She had never dared to make such a
comparison. She took out the Fire Dates her mother had rewarded her and
shared them with Red Boy, changing the subject to talk about anecdotes in
the mountains. Seeing this, Red Boy didn't press further and responded
perfunctorily.

Pingping cautiously said, "Brother, you and I have always been the closest.
If you have something on your mind, you can tell me. It's not easy for our
family to be reunited. I just want to live peacefully in these mountains,
away from worldly strife."

Gazing at the burning clouds, Red Boy said, "Sister, you should see more of
the outside world. There's no such thing as living away from worldly
strife. It's just self-deception of losers!"

Pingping wanted to ask him who he was competing with and why he had
to compete. But before she could speak, she felt a blow to the back of her
neck and fainted.

## Rakshasi

> From dawn to dusk, toil's bitter strain,
> Day and night, home's burdens remain.
> Destiny shows no mercy, merciful she became
> Why is her household light the hardest to sustain?

Mount Lingshan, Vulture Peak, before the Thunderclap Temple.
Rakshasi clasped her intertwined hands tightly, steadying her trembling
body, striving to appear calm and serene.

She had traveled to many places on this journey: domains of the yaoguai
kings she befriended in the mortal realm, abodes of the gods she met in
the celestial realm, the immortal islands on the sea, and even the
underworld. She had visited them all.

She also went to the Tushita Palace to seek advice from her master. Yet the
latter had only offered a heartfelt persuasion: "I ordered you to raise a
child, but I did not ask you to be a true mother. Let the boy stir his trouble;
as long as you and your husband stay out of it, you will be safe."

Her master's words left her in despair. She knew that no protection would
the Flaming Mountains receive. This was their destiny ordained.

But she knew her son all too well—-reckless and wild, vengeful and
unforgiving. After all the suffering he had endured over the years, unless
he could vent his anger, the only way to resolve the siege of Flaming
Mountains would be to break his spine.

Thus, she came here

For revenge.

How to exact it?

She had no idea, her mind a blank void.

"Lady Rakshasi, the master summons you inside." Ananda stood at the
temple door, his voice as gentle as ever.

She straightened her back, gripping the Plantain Fan tightly in her hand,
and hoarsely replied, "Thank you, Venerable."

As she walked into the hall, flanked by the Eight Great Vajras and five
hundred Arhats, she seemed to hear faint laughter, but all she saw in her
peripheral vision were solemn and dignified figures.

Reaching the base of the lotus throne, she knelt with her head held high,
clutching the fan tightly.

"Rakshasi, what brings you here to seek an audience with me?"

She remained silent, gripping the fan with all her might, ready to unleash
its divine wind at any moment.

The hall was deathly quiet.

All eyes were on her; she could feel the Vajras glaring with their angry
eyes, the Arhats staring with their wrathful gazes, and all the divine figures
transforming into fierce visages.

"I..." She lowered her head. "'.."

"I greet you on behalf of my master."

A booming laughter echoed, deafening. Within that laughter, she heard
the cries of an infant, the innocent giggles of a child, the roars of an
adolescent, and the cycle ofblooming and withering flowers, the growth
of grass and the flight of orioles over millennia.

She heard the embers extinguishing in the Flaming Mountains.

## Bull King

> Renowned as the mighty king, his life was far from plain,
> His spirit spanned the three realms, his fame touched four domains.
> Among the guais, a hero grand, wild and untamed,
> The sudden arrival of dharma left his homeland forever changed.
> With shadow as his companion, true enlightenment within him lay.

In days of yore, the Bull King converted to Buddhism and, within a
century, completed his practice and returned to the Flaming Mountains.
Overjoyed, Rakshasi and Pingping loudly celebrated his return and hosted
a grand banquet in his honor.

During the banquet, the Keeper of the Flaming Mountains asked, "My
king, why did you return so hastily?"

The Bull King replied, "An old friend, with whom I had some
misunderstandings in the past, helped me achieve a great merit. The
Bodhisattva then pleaded with the Buddha on my behalf, granting me the
grace to return. From now on, I will stay in the mountain and go nowhere
else."

From that day on, the Bull King's temperament changed drastically. His
former wild and unrestrained nature was no longer seen. He declined all
invitations, ceased his travels, and instead stayed in Flaming Mountains,
helping Rakshasi with household affairs and training the bull soldiers,
living a very peaceful life.

Several decades later, Red Boy received instructions from the Bodhisattva
and returned to Flaming Mountains to serve his parents. The family of
four enjoyed a period of peace.

However, Rakshasi gradually noticed something unusual about the Bull
King. He became increasingly thin, his face showing signs of aging, and he
ate less, as if weighed down by heavy worries. More strangely, the Bull
King sometimes transformed into his original form, retreating to the
mountain peaks, retching.

The furry celestial maidens serving Rakshasi said, "The King might be
suffering from a rare bovine illness."

The fox maidens serving Pingping said, "The King, aware of his past sins,
might have learned an ascetic practice in Mount Lingshan and is now
undergoing it."

The Keeper of Flaming Mountains said, "The King's mind is trapped in the
past intertwines with his old friend, unable to break free. Those past
events have become an invisible shackles, and from which, he never
escape."

## Supreme Celestial Inspector

> The mighty Inspector, the emperor's guard so grand,
> Rides fiery wheels, at the celestial gate to stand.
> Upholding justice, silent and stern,
> With one steel whip, the souls burn.

In the Celestial Court, it was a well-known fact among gods and Buddhas
that Taiyi Thunderclap Supreme, also known as the Supreme Inspector,
was the Jade Emperor's most loyal enforcer. If his gaze was fixed upon
someone, it spelled certain doom. Admiral Tianpeng, who was cast down
to become a pig, served as a prime example; once a prominent rising star,
he vanished without a trace after the Supreme Inspector reported him.

Initially, the Supreme Inspector did not have his current peculiar
appearance. Though not as handsome as Tianpeng, he was at least
presentable. Later, the Jade Emperor, in appreciation of the Inspector's
impartial enforcement of his decrees, transformed the Inspector's head
into the shape of his right hand, symbolizing that when the Inspector was
present, it is as if the Jade Emperor himself was there.

When deities encountered the Inspector, they respectfully greeted him
and then quickly distanced themselves. They dared not engage in any
high-spirited discussions in his presence, fearing that any mistake might
be caught and reported.

Although the Inspector had no close companions, he did have some
interactions with an old god of very high rank in the Celestial Court, aside
from the Jade Emperor.

Some immortals said that since the Inspector willingly took on such a
significant role, he deserved to endure this solitude; every advantage came
with a disadvantage. Others argued that the Inspector accepted this
unappealing position precisely because he preferred not to socialize,
finding himself perfectly at ease and content in his role. Opinions were
divided, and no consensus was reached. As for what the Inspector truly
thought, no one knew.

## Mandrill Chief

> A heart caring with dreams unclear,
> She left the mountain, ventured far and near.
> Seeking the Five Skandhas, found naught,
> True wisdom lies in letting go, she's taught.

The "Tripitaka Scriptures" depict the Mandrill as possessing extraordinary
abilities, capable of grasping the sun and moon, shrinking mountains,
discerning fortunes, and manipulating the universe with its power.

In Mount Huaguo, a day unlike any other unfolded. The Mandrill Chief
was leaping through the mountains when she suddenly saw the celestial
stone on the mountaintop explode, producing a stone egg. As the wind
blew over it, the stone egg transformed into a stone monkey. The Mandrill
Chief approached to observe, and the stone monkey began to mimic,
learning to crawl and walk. Subsequently, the stone monkey bowed to the
four directions, and its eyes emitted two beams of golden light that shot
up to the Celestial Palace. Delighted, the Mandrill Chief brought the stone
monkey into the forest to meet the other monkeys. This extraordinary
stone monkey soon proved its worth and, after a series of contests, became
the king of the monkeys, earning the title "Handsome Monkey King."

For three to five hundred years, the Monkey King led the monkeys in
carefree joy. One day, he began to worry about life and death. The
Mandrill Chief advised the Monkey King to go out and seek the Dao. After
the Monkey King returned, he rewarded the Mandrill Chief by appointing
her as a general. Later, the Monkey King was titled the Great Sage, became
a celestial official, caused havoc in the Celestial Palace, was subdued and
imprisoned under a mountain, became a monk, achieved enlightenment,
and finally became a Buddha... After several rises and falls, he ultimately
returned to the mountain and transformed back into a stone.

One day, an immortal appeared in the dream to the Mandrill Chief, telling
her that all Five Skandhas are empty and can transcend all suffering. The
immortal explained that if she could visit all the sacred places and temples
in the world, gather the essence of the Five Skandhas, and make the Five
Skandhas Pill, she might be able to awaken the stone and restore its divine
spirit.

Thus, she traveled across the three realms and four lands, searching for
ingredients to make the pill, until she encountered a monkey that looked
exactly like the Monkey King...

## Yin Tiger

> Wind fans the flames, the hammer strikes,
> Swords dance, blades sweep the dust aside.
> With iron will, one finds their way,
> Between stillness and motion, greatness will stay.

In the Hall of Yuanchen, Yin Tiger stood before the anvil, hammering
away. Several young Daoist apprentices surrounded him, fanning the
flames and adding wood and charcoal to the fire. Suddenly, the hall doors
were kicked open, and the gatekeeper boy chased in with the Great Sage.
Yin Tiger signalled to the apprentices with a glance, and they quickly left.
The Great Sage approached the anvil, threw a set of armor on the ground,
and placed one foot on the edge of the anvil, laughing,"Brother Tiger, this
armor those immortals granted me doesn't suit me at all. Why don't you
better it for me? I trust your craftsmanship."

Yin Tiger glanced at the Great Sage's Cloudtreaders and said, "You come
to ask for my help with such disrespect? Your foot."

The Great Sage, with a cheeky smile on his face, lowered his foot and said,
"I care nothing about those grand rules above. We've known each other
for ages; why bother with manners?"

Yin Tiger didn't respond. The Great Sage grabbed the large cleaver the
Tiger had been hammering, tested its weight, and shook his head, "Too
light, that is. It doesn't suit you."

Only then did Yin Tiger pick up the armor from the ground, examine it,
and say, "Your gold armor is excellent. Why bother with this scrap metal?"

The Great Sage leaped onto the Tiger's large chair and laughed, "That's
why I brought it here. You don't really have to waste your hammerings on
it. If anyone asks, just say you're working on it."

Yin Tiger refused, "Take it back. I won't play along with your act."
The Great Sage wasn't offended. He untied the precious gourd from his
waist and said, "Actually, I came to drink. Go call everyone. Remember to
invite my good brother Shen Monkey and bring some of his homemade
wine. To drink mine, you guys got to offer something too."

Later, the Great Sage drank and reveled with everyone in the Hall of
Yuanchen until he was hammered and had to be escorted back by celestial
officials. After he left, Yin Tiger noticed that the armor was still lying
beside his anvil. Well then, he would have to return it to him another day.

## Chen Loong

> Craving fortune's smile, but met with bitter strife,
> Toiling by dark waters, in a grumpy life.
> In that realm of paint, the last hopes retreat,
> The green one brought him sweetness, a long-awaited treat.

A scroll lay spread out on the desk, surrounded by four figures: a skinny
monkey, a mangy dog, an old loong, and a fierce tiger.
The old loong asked, "The Sacred Divinity sent us such a treasure. Do you
know his intent?"

The skinny monkey laughed strangely, "1 don't know. Maybe it's meant to
be hung up for decoration. If you don't want it, I'll trade it for wine."

The mangy dog, holding a palm fan, paced around the desk twice and said,
"We were banished to the mortal realm because of the Great Sage's affair.
Undoubtedly, it must be related to this. However, he..." His voice trailed
off, unsure how to proceed.

The fierce tiger, frustrated by the dog's hesitation, asked, "Do you mean to
say, is he here to help or to harm?"

The mangy dog fanned himself and retorted, "Such profound matters
cannot be spoken of so crudely."

The old loong asked, "What's on your minds?"

The skinny monkey lounged in his seat and said, "Not to help, not to help.
I'm just a drunkard. What good can I do but earn some wine money? The
rest is none of my concern." With that, he closed his eyes and pretended
to sleep, saying no more.

The fierce tiger chuckled and added, "I only know how to smith. If
someone comes seeking my help, I assist them, and that's all."

The mangy dog, growing anxious, exclaimed, "Why are you all cowering
in fear? We used to act justly. Look at us now, as if things could possibly
get any worse. I will lend my aid, I will lend my aid!

The old loong quickly intervened, "Brother, patience. We understand
your intentions. We need a plan, so if the Sacred Divinity reprimand us,
We have a response."

He paused, and the other three nodded in agreement. He continued,
"Since we are of the same plan, let's proceed accordingly. Each of us
should prepare and set off on an appointed day."

![Chen Loong](/image-20240828221411596.png)

## Shen Monkey

> Bottom up the jade nectar, a celestial brew,
> In the jar, the fresh wine sparkles anew.
> In worldly clamor, he wishes to stay drunk,
> Forgetting homeland, foreign lands amok.

In Chang'an city stood the Temple of the Wild Goose Pagoda. Not far from
its gates lived a diligent temple-goer named Hao Desheng.

One day, Desheng dozed off as he sat at ease at home. In his dream, he
found himself at the temple gate. Four figures approached: a monkey, a
dog, a loong, and a tiger, all deep in talk. He heard the tiger ask, "Where
do you plan to take that thing?"

The loong shook his head. "Fret not. I hear they've all returned to their
caves. We need but make our way to each place and wait. Our meeting is
sure."

The dog then inquired, "May I ask, friends, where are you all off to?"
The monkey replied, "I'm not fond of the sun, rain, or chill wind. For
drinking, I shall seek out a lush and lovely spot."

The loong stretched his neck. "I need to dwell by the water. If your place
has a water view, we might dwell near."

The monkey waved him off. "I've seen that ugly mug of yours for all my
long years. Better we live far and distant from each other."

The loong paid him no heed and asked the dog, "And you, young one?
What plans do you have? Perhaps we can..."

The dog said, "No, no, the time isn't ripe. It's still too early. I'd rather head
to the mortal world, and have myself some experiences first."

"Hah, experiences!" scoffed the tiger. "You just yearn the hunt for rare
herbs to play with your furnace."

The dog flushed, but before he could retort, the monkey turned to the
tiger."And you? What's your plan?"

The tiger thumped his chest. "I'll guard the village."

Seeing his friends had made their choices, the old loong said, "Well then,
we don't need to travel together. Here's where we part ways, each to seek
our path. When I meet that one, I'll gather you all again."

With that, the four parted. Desheng heard a thunderclap and woke with a
start. The dream had already faded from his mind.

![Shen Monkey](/image-20240828221432244.png)

## Xu Dog

> No divine arts, no meditation's trance,
> With a palm fan, he nurtures his pill's dance.
> A sincere heart, the medicine he seeks,
> Bored by human woes and worldly techniques.

At the eastern end of Qingxu Alley stood a modest Daoist temple, home to
a solitary Daoist. This Daoist professed to have discovered the ancient
formula for an immortality pill from the sea, earning him a reputation as a
miraculous healer.

The Daoist's pills, when taken by the sick, showed no significant
improvement, and when taken by the healthy, had no noticeable effect. If
anyone inquired about their efficacy, he would calmly explain,"There is
no such thing as a wondrous cure-all pill that can bring the dead back to
life. True health arises from the harmony and smooth flow of one's
essence, vigor, and spirit." Consequently, people began to doubt the
Daoist's skills, leading to his temple being sparsely visited and few seeking
his medical assistance.

In the city, there was an old man named Mr. Chen, whose wealth rivaled
that of nobility. Now in his sixties, he had fallen gravely ill, showing signs
of being near the end of his life. His son sought out the Daoist and invited
him to treat his ailing father.

The Daoist had a yellow dog that he kept by his side at all times. This time,
he brought it along to the Chen residence. The Daoist prepared many
special pills for Mr. Chen. Although the household servants thought he
Was merely going through the motions, they dared not say much and
watched from the sidelines.

Unexpectedly, after taking the pills, Mr. Chen gradually began to eat and
drink a little, and his breathing became smoother, showing signs of
recovery. Yet, just when everything was getting better, in one of the
Daoist's pill-making sessions, his furnace exploded, killing him in the
process.

The household servants came to clean up the Daoist temporary quarters,
lamenting the whims of fate. To their astonishment, they saw the Daoist's
yellow dog, dressed in his clothes, walking out of the room. The dog was
fanning itself with a tattered palm-leaf fan and said, "1 had planned to
learn some mortal skills in the human world. Who would have thought
that in this world, great talent brings such peril!"

With that, the dog snapped the fan, and disappeared.

![Xu Dog](/image-20240828221452450.png)

## The Old Monkey

> Countless souls pursue the immortal quest,
> Seeking the Dao, but truth is not addressed.
> The ferry itself will never be ashore,
> Ask not when fruits will ripen, in the void they fade evermore.

Some say he is Bodhisattva Guanyin.

Some say he is Patriarch Bodhi.

Some say he is Sun Wukong himself.

Others say he is just an unnamed old monkey in the mountains.

With the same posture, he always starts with the same line.

Sometimes, the mountaintop is empty and silent.

Sometimes, the summit is bustling with monkey cries.

Whenever a Destined One sets out on their journey, he gifts them with a
handmade willow staff.

As he breaks off the willow branch to send them off, he feels a twinge of
reluctance in his heart.

The Immortals of the Celestial Court say he is gambling.

The Buddha on Mount Lingshan says that gambling inevitably leads to
loss.

He says he neither gambles nor loses.

He is just waiting for the stories the Destined Ones will tell him upon their
return.

And he has never heard two identical stories.

![The Old Monkey](/image-20240828221512020.png)

## Maitreya

> The board is earth, the pieces sky,
> Colors of Yin and Yang comply.
> In subtle moves, revolutions blend,
> Laughing, praise the game that will never end.

Maitreya had been in the Great Pagoda for an unknown length of time.

When the Sacred Divinity arrived, the mural was still unfinished.

"1 knew you would come," Maitreya said with a smile.

The Sacred Divinity cupped his hands in salute, "Your wisdom is
unparalleled, Venerable One. You must have foreseen this day back on
Mount Huaguo. Therefore, I beseech you, please, relieve me of my inner
turmoil."

"Since your turmoil stem from Sun Wukong, he should be the one to
answer them."

"He is dead," the Sacred Divinity said, his voice faltering as if unwilling to
utter the word.

"I have already opened the path for you. No one will disturb you there.
Take your time to ponder," Maitreya said, stepping aside. Instantly, wind
and snow swirled in from the opposite wall, casting a chill throughout the
pagoda.

The Sacred Divinity stepped forward as instructed, stopping at the edge of
the void. He turned back and said, "By stepping into this painted Mount
Mei today, the Celestial Court will not be able to find me. Venerable One,
Would Mount Lingshan know of your deeds?"

Maitreya laughed, "Have we met before? The Erlang Shen I know is much
uglier than you.."

Hearing this, the Sacred Divinity said no more and strode into the wind
and snow.

![Maitreya](/image-20240828221530021.png)

## Erlang, the Sacred Divinity

> In skies high, his talents shine, like plum blooms pure and bright,
> His form defies the winter's snow, a sacred being of light.
> With lofty heart, he claims no kin to the emperor above,
> His noble spirit dims the stars, unlocking the Great Pagoda.

"These are just monkeys, none of them has anything worthwhile."

A celestial soldier used his spear to flip over a corpse, complaining to his
fellow. Before them lay the aftermath of the battle at Mount Huaguo:
jagged rocks, ancient trees charred by lightning, and bodies strewn across
the landscape.

"The good stuff is all in the Water Curtain Cave. We only get to clean up
the battlefield," replied the fellow.

"True. We just do the dirty work, finishing off those who aren't quite dead
yet." With that, the celestial soldier thrust his spear into a corpse and
pulled it out again.

They methodically checked each body until they reached a large boulder.
The celestial soldier knocked on the stone. Watching this, his fellow said,
"It's just a rock. What do you expect to find out of it?"

The celestial soldier replied, "Don't you know? This is Sun Wukong."

The fellow looked puzzled. "Nonsense, how could this be Sun Wukong?"

"He died earlier, with his six roots severed and given to the yaoguai kings.
Born from a stone, and now with his senses gone, he naturally turned back
into stone after death."

"Bollocks," said his fellow.

"You don't believe it?" The celestial soldier boasted, "I was at the front of
the formation and saw it clearly. When they dismembered his body, even
the Sacred Divinity took a piece."

The fellow, curious, asked, "I don't remember you being at the front... Is
that true? Even the Sacred Divinity tooka piece? I saw all those yaoguai
kings from the lower realms today. I thought only yaoguais would take
things from other yaoguais."

"He's not just any yaoguai; he was once granted Buddhahood," corrected
the celestial soldier.

"Why would the Sacred Divinity take that? Isn't it considered bad luck?"

"Who knows? Sun Wukong was powerful. Maybe consuming it would be
highly beneficial." They both laughed heartily.

"Hey, look at this," said the fellow, noticing something white beside the
stone.

They picked it up and found it was a branch of plum blossoms, as white as
jade, as pure as snow, blooming fragrantly.

The celestial soldier wondered, "How could there be plum blossoms on
Mount Huaguo?"

The fellow said, "This looks somewhat like..."

Before he could finish, a spearhead pierced through his chest, emitting a
golden light that even dispersed the soul within his armor.

The celestial soldier looked over his fallen fellow's shoulder, shocked.
Before he could react, the golden light flashed again.

White clouds drifted past, leaving the mountain peak in tranquility once
more.

![Erlang, the Sacred Divinity](/image-20240828221547637.png)

## The Great Sage's Broken Shell

> Three Yangs converge, life springs forth anew,
> The celestial stone holds sun and moon's hue.
> From an egg, a monkey's path is laid,
> A future arises with his form made.
> Within, no form to recognize,
> Without, a shape before everyone's eyes.
> Talented ones emerged through ages,
> How few achieved the Dao among kings and sages!

The table was a mess, and after three rounds of drinks, the two sitting
across from each other were completely hammered.

"Bajie, my brother, I'm done being the Victorious Fighting Buddha.
Whoever wants the darn title can have it," Wukong said, his face red and
blood boiling. It was unclear whether he was truly drunk or just
pretending.

Bajie, straightforward as always, replied, "Brother, enlightenment we've
attained. Being free, we can drink to our hearts' content. Shouldn't we be
happy?.

Wukong sneered, "Yes, attaining Buddhahood for the removal of my
headband was indeed a good deal."

"Exactly. With the headband gone, you don't have to fear Master chanting
anymore. Doesn't call for two more toast?" Bajie said, still trying to
persuade Wukong to drink more, despite his own muddled state.

"Bajie, you enjoy drinking, but if someone wanted to have you served as
their side dish for drinking, would you still be this happy?"

"Who wants to eat me? My nine-toothed rake won't allow it," Bajie said,
slamming the table.

"Well, that would be much more difficult than you think," Wukong
waved his hand dismissively, his face distainful. "If they wanted to eat you,
there wouldn't even be bones left."

"They? Who are you talking about?"

"Let me ask you, on our iourney, how many vaoguais did we encounter?
And how many did we kill?"

"Too many! Lost count. Remember? Whenever you get bored or lazy,
you'd send me to clear out those caves and lairs."

"Not counting the lesser ones, how many of the powerful ones did we
kill??.

"1 don't remember...,probably killed them all."

"Setting aside the tree guais from the Wood Immortal Hut and those
seven spiders, we killed less than half of the ones we fought."

"Seven...seven spiders? Oh, I remember now."

"The other half. we didn't kill. Do vou know why?"

"Why?""

"Because we mustn't kill them."

"Hmph, that was before. Now we're celestial beings ourselves. If it pleases
us, we can go kill them now!"

Wukong sighed, "Bajie, why don't we resign from our positions and
retire? I'll go back to my mountain, and you can return to your village."

Bajie was stunned, not understanding why Wukong suddenly changed
the topic.

"I'm not going back. If you want to leave, go ahead. Now, I don't have to
lift a finger. and there's an endless supply of tributes and all kinds of
delicacies. If I go back, I'll have to work the fields. I can't bear the toil!"

"These tributes should go to those who need them more. If we eat them,
those people will have less to eat."

"What happened to you? Weren't all our struggle just for this? Don't tell
me you wish to go begging for alms with our master like before!"

"Forget it, forget it. Let's drink."

Bajie couldn't remember when Wukong left the table.

Before he blacked out from drinking, the last thing he remembered his
brother said was-

"Immortality? It's not for me."

## Yuan Shoucheng

Half a life in vain, half a life in haste,
One dawn of clarity, one dawn erased.

Prophecies lag behind the schemes of man,
No augury can stay an obsessed hand.

Waves upon waves, the world's perils lie,
Dust upon dust, uncountable debts beneath the sky.

Gatherings and partings like morning dew,
Grudges and loves like lightning, passing through.

A thousand years of rise and fall, nothing new,
A century's success and failure, something true.

Harvesting deeds, by the destiny's decree,
Fates rise and fall, as sunsets flee.

Harsh words spoken, ears they defy,
Careless talk, hearts they pry.

Crude strokes mar the eye's delight,
Intent to sketch, wounds for sight.

Yaoguais and Buddhas, all in me,
Fiends and gods, alike we see.

My tears flow like springs, don't ask why,
Laughing to the sky, it's folly's cry.
